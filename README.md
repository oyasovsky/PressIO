## Your one stop shop for article templating

PressIO is an RSS based article template generator. Click on one of the collected RSS tags on the top. The more sources it has, the better the result!

Our tool will automatically grab fresh articles from various sources like Google and miscellenious news feeds, crunch the data and modify it for uniqueness and better SEO.

We also collect article related images so you could choose to keep any of them or replace them with your own.

After generation you can tweak the suggested article by typing free text or editing the generated paragraphs directly from the WYSWYG editor.

Drag suggested unused paragraphs from the column on the left to enrich your text.

Toggle the 'Use Synonyms' and 'Close Synonyms' to choose your desired text and modify the suggested article.

Finally...
Save your article as an HTML, Audio or Video file from the ribbon menu of the editor. Feel free to embed it in your site!

Happy Generating!
