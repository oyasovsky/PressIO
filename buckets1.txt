","The first production units were delivered in July 2015. ","Unlike the Valkyrie, the Icon A5 is primarily a recreational aircraft. ","It can be flown by anyone holding a [sport|frolic|lark|rollick|skylark|disport] [pilot|navigate|fly|aviate|fender] [license|licence|certify|permission|permit] -- which takes about half the [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] to get as a standard [license|licence|certify|permission|permit].","In addition to a [sleek|satiny|silken|silky|silklike], [compact|compendious|succinct|summary|heavyset] [design|plan|project|contrive|invention] and intuitive high-visibility cockpit, one of the Icon A5's selling points is its foldability.","It also fits in most car garages and can be towed behind a vehicle for overland [transport|transmit|transfer|channel|channelize]. ","Icon Aircraft claims to have already received more than 1,800 orders for the Icon A5. ","That amounts to about a $400 million [order|rate|rank|range|grade] [book|reserve|hold|Bible|Christian Bible], which is likely to make investors happy -- an illustrious roster that includes Ross Perot Jr. and [Google|google|]'s Eric Schmidt. ","The [base|baseborn|mean|meanspirited|immoral] [price|Price|Leontyne Price|Mary Leontyne Price|cost] of the aircraft is $197,000, rising to $247,000 with additional features.

They were [observe|keep|maintain|watch|follow]d on September 14, 2015.","Scientists [hear|listen|take heed|try|learn]d the [sound|heavy|profound|wakeless|legal] of the [black|smutty|disgraceful|ignominious|inglorious] holes colliding as a [chirp|tweedle|peep|cheep|chirrup] [last|lastly|in conclusion|finally|last-place]ing one-fifth of a [second|secondly|2nd|2d|back].

","Life on Mars: Depends on what you see in this [picture|depict|render|show|visualize]","LIGO is described as a system of two identical [detect|observe|find|discover|notice]ors -- one located in Livingston, Louisiana, the other in Hanford, Washington -- carefully constructed to [detect|observe|find|discover|notice] incredibly tiny vibrations from passing gravitational waves. The [project|externalize|externalise|send off|cast] was created by scientists from Caltech and MIT and funded by the National Science Foundation.","Szabolcs Marka, a physicist at Columbia University who is leader of the LIGO member Columbia Experimental Gravity [Group|group|aggroup|mathematical group|radical|chemical group], said you could [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] of it as a cosmic microphone.","","Gravitational waves were predicted by Einstein in his [general|cosmopolitan|ecumenical|oecumenical|universal] theory of relativity in 1915, the theory that proposed [space|quad|blank space|place|distance]-[time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] as a concept. The waves are a distortion of [space|quad|blank space|place|distance]-[time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter].","However, in [order|rate|rank|range|grade] for us to [detect|observe|find|discover|notice] them, they needed to be created by a mammoth event -- for example, the collision of two [black|smutty|disgraceful|ignominious|inglorious] holes.","[Black|black|smutty|disgraceful|ignominious|inglorious] holes are a holy grail of the gravitational [wave|curl|roll|undulate|flap] concept. To [date|go steady|go out|see|date stamp], we'd been able only to see their aftereffects. [Black|black|smutty|disgraceful|ignominious|inglorious] holes themselves were a [conjecture|speculate|theorize|theorise|hypothesize]. ","There's been a [lot|distribute|administer|mete out|deal|parcel out] of indirect [evidence|tell|testify|bear witness|prove] for their existence, says Shoemaker, an expert in [black|smutty|disgraceful|ignominious|inglorious] [hole|hole out|trap|cakehole|maw]s. But this is the first [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] we actually [detect|observe|find|discover|notice] two [black|smutty|disgraceful|ignominious|inglorious] [hole|hole out|trap|cakehole|maw]s merging and we [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] the only thing that predicts that (is) gravitational radiation, (which) comes from a binary [black|smutty|disgraceful|ignominious|inglorious] [hole|hole out|trap|cakehole|maw] merging. There's no other way we could have seen that but gravitationally.","","But is LIGO [correct|right|adjust|set|decline]? [Have|take|have|give birth|deliver|bear] we really detected gravitational waves?","Scientists have what they [call|predict|foretell|prognosticate|forebode] a five-sigma standard of [proof|proof|proofread|validation|substantiation], and LIGO's researchers [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out] the gravitational [wave|curl|roll|undulate|flap] discovery exceeds that.","It took six months of convincing ourselves that it was [correct|right|adjust|set|decline], says Shoemaker. It goes beyond that five-sigma to proving that nothing was happening with the equipment that couldn't be understood. ","She's thrilled with the possibilities.","[Imagine|think|opine|suppose|imagine|reckon] having never been able to [hear|listen|take heed|try|learn] before and all you can do is see, she says. Now we can [listen|heed|mind|hear|take heed] to the universe where we were [deaf|deaf|indifferent|deafen] before. It's a different spectrum (from the electromagnetic spectrum). It's unlike anything we've ever detected before.","What's really exciting is what comes next, said Reitze at the announcement. I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] we're opening a window on the universe -- a window of gravitational [wave|curl|roll|undulate|flap] astronomy.","","Columbia University physicist Marka, who's been working on the [project|externalize|externalise|send off|cast] for more than a decade, said the discovery [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] [open|candid|heart-to-heart|clear|capable] up new horizons, including [direct|directly|straight|verbatim|lineal] tests of Einstein's [general|cosmopolitan|ecumenical|oecumenical|universal] theory. Those could [further|farther|promote|advance|boost] [support|digest|endure|stick out|stomach|bear] it -- or [force|storm|drive|ram|wedge] physicists to come up with new ideas.","A physicist is always looking for a [flaw|blemish|defect|fault] in a theory.

She helped [generate|beget|get|engender|father|mother] [buzz|hum|seethe|bombinate|bombilate] for her son in New Hampshire, and it was assumed she would be met with [even|yet|still|tied|level] more fanfare in South Carolina, where she attended high [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize] at Ashley Hall in [Charleston|capital of West Virginia].","He's done the most amazing things as governor. He's a great son. He's a great [father|beget|get|engender|mother]. He's a great [husband|conserve|economize|economise|hubby]. He's a great friend. He's loyal, she said, while introducing her son at his final South Carolina town hall in the town of Central on Friday night.

","I'm proud of the [campaign|take the field|crusade|fight|press] that we have [run|unravel|ladder|melt|melt down] to [unify|unite|merge|mix|mingle] the country.

","After another two hours or so, at approximately 12:40 a.m., [police|patrol|police force|constabulary|law] took Dalton, 45, into custody, ending a nearly seven-hour nightmare.","[Police|patrol|police|police force|constabulary|law] seized a semiautomatic handgun from Dalton, whom Getting described as [even|yet|still|tied|level]-tempered at the [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] of his [arrest|halt|hold|catch|get].

","","For the past 10 years, Sally and Gary Pardo have lived across the street from Dalton's [single|single|undivided|exclusive|individual|unmarried]-family [home|home|interior|internal|national] on Douglas Street in Kalamazoo. ","Sally Pardo told CNN that Dalton is married with two children and that they seemed to be a typical American family.

A [team|team up|squad] of marines approached one of El Chapo's mountain [top|top|top off|crown|pinch] ranches by jungle road, while another [group|aggroup|mathematical group|radical|chemical group] of commandos flew in by helicopter.

I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] the only thing I should have done different was been a little more aggressive coming to the [line|trace|draw|describe|delineate], holding Denny up the [race|rush|run|hotfoot|hasten] [track|traverse|cover|cross|pass over]. That [last|lastly|in conclusion|finally|last-place] [split|disconnected|disunited|fragmented|burst] [second|secondly|2nd|2d|back] when he pulled [off|away|forth|sour|turned] my door, that was it.

Edwards was fifth as Toyota took four of the [top|top|top off|crown|pinch] five spots. It comes three months after Busch gave Toyota its first championship.","This was our 10th [try|try on|render|strain|stress] at the Daytona 500, said David Wilson, president of Toyota Racing Development, who called the [win|earn|garner|succeed|come through] the biggest in Toyota history - trumping [even|yet|still|tied|level] the 2003 Indianapolis 500 victory.","When we came into the [sport|frolic|lark|rollick|skylark|disport], we struggled. We were not [ready|quick|ready|fix|prepare]. We didn't [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out]. And so it's taken [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] for us to collectively [build|build up|work up|ramp up|establish] an organization of winning races and competing for championships.","Kenseth faded to 14th.","They [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t get much more crushing than that, Kenseth said. If I can't [win|earn|garner|succeed|come through], I [want|need|require|desire|wish] my teammate to [win|earn|garner|succeed|come through]. There's a million things you could do differently, but I did what I thought I should do at the [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] to [try|try on|render|strain|stress] to [win|earn|garner|succeed|come through]. We finished terrible, but that was the [move|make a motion|go|run|motivate] I thought I had to make to [try|try on|render|strain|stress] to [preserve|keep|save|conserve|maintain] the [win|earn|garner|succeed|come through].","Dale Earnhardt Jr., seeking his third Daytona 500 victory, came up [empty|empty-bellied|hollow|vacuous|evacuate] as he tried to [force|storm|drive|ram|wedge] his way through the [field|airfield|landing field|flying field|field of view] late in the [race|rush|run|hotfoot|hasten].","Earnhardt was using the high [line|trace|draw|describe|delineate] to [inch|edge|column inch|in] closer to the [front|front|breast|look|face], and when he tried to get a [side|side|English|slope|incline] [draft|blueprint|draught|enlist|muster in] from another car, he spun through the fourth [turn|sour|ferment|work|call on].
