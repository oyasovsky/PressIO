At stake are 50 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination.","Donald Trump goes into the vote as the front-runner after a frenzied final week of campaigning that saw the billionaire real-estate mogul wage a rhetorical war with Pope Francis and several candidates bluntly accuse their rivals of peddling outright lies.","Live updates: Nevada Democratic caucuses and South Carolina Republican primary","There was a furor over doctored pictures of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in a Photoshopped handshake with President Barack Obama and a shouting match -- again initiated by Trump's willingness to slay sacred cows -- over who was to blame for 9/11.",""],"secondary":["And Trump again managed to draw controversy in his final rally before the primary Friday night, when he told an apocryphal story of Gen. John Pershing, who purportedly dipped bullets in pigs' blood to execute Muslim prisoners a century ago in an effort to deter Islamic terrorism. Rubio, speaking to NBC's \"Today\" show on Saturday, called the tale \"bizarre\" and said \"that's not what the United States is all about.\"","Former President George W. Bush himself was back on the trail for the first time since leaving the White House, showing that his campaign skills are as polished as ever. But the 43rd president may not have done enough to rescue his brother Jeb, who is struggling to gain traction.","The latest CNN Poll of Polls on Friday showed Trump potentially on the verge of another huge victory to back up his thumping win in New Hampshire last week.","The businessman led with 34% support, ahead of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 20% and Rubio at 15%. Bush was fourth with 11%, ahead of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 8%.","Related: 5 takeaways from the CNN Republican town hall","One point back was Ohio Gov. John Kasich. He might get a pass in South Carolina, however, because his more-moderate conservative profile is a weaker fit in the Palmetto State than in New Hampshire, where he came in second last week.","A Trump victory in South Carolina on Saturday would send new shockwaves through the Republican establishment and possibly augur another strong showing for the front-runner in Southern states with a similar ideological profile on Super Tuesday, March 1.","Despite an aberration in 2012, when the state's Republican voters went for Newt Gingrich, the South Carolina primary has historically been a barometer of party opinion, going for the eventual nominee in every other presidential primary since 1980.","It's also a good approximation of the party as a whole. It has a mixture of conservative and evangelical voters, particularly in the northwest of the state, and an influential bloc of retired military veterans who hanker for a tough message on national security, with more moderate Republicans on the Atlantic coast where cities have swelled with migrants from northern states.","The race is another test of whether the outspoken former reality star can defy political logic after firing off a string of political assaults, notably accusing George W. Bush of not doing enough to thwart the September 11 attacks and of lying America into the Iraq war. Bush remains popular in South Carolina, so while Trump's attacks could endear him to his anti-establishment base, they also could backfire.","But Trump appears confident that his lead will hold up on Saturday, having proven that his campaign, despite doubts about his ground game, was able to turn poll numbers into significant amounts of votes in New Hampshire.","Trump -- who has taken aim at establishment figures throughout his campaign -- also found himself at odds with the head of the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday, when Pope Francis warned that his talk of building walls to keep out immigrants was hardly Christian.","The spat may have helped Trump, given the lack of Roman Catholics in South Carolina -- 7% according to the beliefnet website. Some evangelicals, meanwhile, mistrust Francis' comparatively progressive views on certain social and economic questions. And the exchange allowed the billionaire to once again dominate the media as he restated a hardline position on illegal immigration popular among many conservatives.","Behind Trump, a furious battle appears to be raging for second place between a pair of Cuban-American senators, Rubio and Cruz, who have engaged in a series of angry exchanges that reflect the intensity of the South Carolina race.","Rubio is looking for a strong performance on Saturday to validate the comeback story he has been building after slumping to fifth place in New Hampshire. Just days earlier he was pummeled in a debate by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has since dropped out of the race.","Rubio secured the endorsement of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, both rising stars in the GOP, and has hired a group of political consultants who learned their trade in the Palmetto State so must deal with rising expectations for a competitive showing on Saturday.","A good result for Cruz, meanwhile, would lend credence to a theory of the campaign that rests on a string of strong performances in very conservative and evangelical Southern states.","In their latest spat, Rubio expressed outrage at a doctored photo distributed by Cruz's campaign purportedly showing him shaking hands with Obama. ","But Cruz hit back by saying Rubio was just like Trump and had a thin skin when it was his turn to absorb an attack. \"They start screaming, 'liar, liar, liar,'\" Cruz said.","Former Florida Gov. Bush, meanwhile, is trying to use South Carolina -- a stronghold for the presidential campaigns of his brother and father -- to launch a comeback after bad showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.","But he has struggled for traction and if he fails to beat Rubio on Saturday, he will face questions about the rationale for continuing a campaign that is currently helping to fracture the establishment wing of the party and leaving an opening for Trump to build momentum."]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160219174656-voters-in-line-in-south-carolina-feb-17-sumter-sc-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.78001","count":"10","text":"Donald Trump","disambiguated":{"subType":["AwardNominee","AwardWinner","Celebrity","CompanyFounder","TVPersonality","TVProducer","FilmActor","TVActor"],"name":"Donald Trump","website":"http://www.trumponline.com/","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_Trump","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0cqt90","opencyc":"http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rv0ncIZwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Donald_Trump"}},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.646702","count":"9","text":"Sen.

","A loss, or even another close finish with Sanders in Nevada, would further chip away at the aura of invincibility that once surrounded her path to the nomination, serving as a testament to the strength of Sanders' momentum even in a heavily Latino state where she was organized six months ahead of him. ","An estimated 40% of the state's Democratic voters are non-white -- and Clinton was expected to show her strength among minority voters with a good showing here. But Sanders has emphasized his family's immigrant roots in ads and on the campaign trail, noting that his father was a Polish immigrant to America who originally spoke little English. ","\"Immigration isn't just a word for Bernie Sanders,\" the narrator said in one Spanish-language radio ad for his campaign in November. \"His story is the immigrant story.\" ","Beyond Clinton's breakneck campaign schedule here this week, there were other signs of concern within her campaign about the unexpected strength of the Sanders effort.","READ: South Carolina heads to the polls after GOP brawl","On the same day that Clinton released an emotional immigration ad featuring Clinton talking to a tearful 10-year-old girl about the deportation letter that her parents received, her operatives added a half-million dollars to their ad spending on broadcast, satellite and cable for a total of $3.4 million to Sanders' $3.7 million, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that tracks political advertising.","The Clinton campaign is also clearly looking at caucus states beyond Nevada, dispatching Bill Clinton to speak to voters in the upcoming contest of Colorado even as the post-caucus celebrations get underway in Nevada Saturday evening.","Clinton repeatedly dropped in on employees at the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip in her efforts to boost Clark County turnout. Both campaigns had heavily courted the powerful Culinary Workers Union, which supported Obama in 2008 and helped him turn out voters to caucus. But in a blow to Clinton's campaign, they chose to stay neutral this year.","Like Obama in 2008, Sanders is counting on a strong turnout from first-time caucusgoers, though not nearly as many are expected as eight years ago when some 120,000 turned out.","Though Clinton is perceived as having an advantage with voters in Clark County, in part because of her strong support from labor unions, Sanders spent a good amount of time campaigning around the populous areas of Las Vegas this week before heading to Elko, Nevada, on Friday to rally rural voters.","During both an MSNBC forum and a speech at the Clark County Democratic Dinner on Thursday night, Sanders made a direct pitch to Latinos by chiding Donald Trump for vilifying immigrants. He argued that Congress \"must move towards a path for citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\"","\"While I understand that there are people who have differences of opinion with me on immigration reform, there is no justification, no reason, to resort to bigotry and xenophobia when we are talking about Mexicans or we are talking about Muslims,\" Sanders said at the Democratic dinner at the Tropicana Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.","\"People can disagree about immigration reform, but in the year 2016, we will not allow the Trumps and others to divide us up and appeal to racism, which has done this country so much harm for so many years,\" he said.","During the MSNBC/Telemundo forum, Sanders also defended his 2007 vote against legislation that would have revamped the immigration system, stating that he objected to guest-worker provisions that were described by one legal advocacy group as being \"akin to slavery.\"  ","Both Sanders and Clinton have also made an aggressive play for Nevada's rural voters this cycle. Clinton won the popular vote here in 2008. But by organizing in the delegate-rich rural counties of Nevada, Obama won more nominating delegates to the Democratic National Convention than Clinton.","Clinton is heavily organized in those rural counties this time. The looming question is whether her campaign will be able to overcome the enthusiasm for Sanders, as well as a palpable level of discomfort with her position on gun control compared to Sanders' more moderate stances. ","At a town hall in Elko Friday morning, Sanders stressed the importance of turnout among rural voters to his campaign, calling on them to show the world the desire for a \"political revolution that transforms this country.\"","\"I really believe this from my heart of hearts: obviously we are here to win and hope to win. I want democracy to flourish,\" Sanders said. \"I hope Nevada turns out -- I hope we have a YUGE turnout -- I'm afraid to use that word! But I hope we have a very, very large voter turnout. Show the world that democracy is alive and well in Nevada.\""]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160215203748-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-composite-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.867521","count":"20","text":"Bernie

in the United States, but Saturday could be a turning point in the race for both parties' presidential nomination contests."],"med":["Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are locked in a tight race in Nevada as Democrats caucus in a state once viewed as a firewall for the former secretary of state. Meanwhile, Republicans in South Carolina are voting in the first-in-the-South primary. Results from both will tell us much about the future of the race and the strength of the contenders.","Here are four things to watch on Saturday.","","Sanders surpassed expectations in New Hampshire by delivering a wallop to Clinton after nearly tying her in Iowa. The caucuses in Nevada will help indicate whether the senator from Vermont has the organizational prowess, ground game and support necessary to deliver a true, long-term challenge to the former secretary of state. ",""],"secondary":["Clinton's campaign initially projected confidence in Nevada, pointing to her appeal to the state's Latino voting population, but after New Hampshire, her team softened the rhetoric about the western state. Still, a victory for Sanders -- or even a result similar to Iowa -- will provide a major boost of momentum for Sanders heading into Super Tuesday. Conversely, if Clinton wins by a solid margin, she can begin to firm up the conventional wisdom that she still is the inevitable nominee. ","By early afternoon in the Silver State, early entrance polls indicated that Sanders was slightly ahead of Clinton, 49% to 47%.","Minority voters are turning out in strong numbers while a large number of attendees identified as liberal, according to the entrance poll results.","The early entrance polls reflect the views of the first few caucusgoers to arrive at each surveyed caucus site, and those arriving early aren't always similar to those who arrive at just before the doors close. These numbers may change as the final caucusgoers are incorporated after doors have closed.","","Businessman Donald Trump has held a consistent polling lead among South Carolina Republicans that is likely to carry him to first place there. If the polls hold up, that could make the race for runner-up the biggest surprise coming out of the primary. ","The Republican race for the nomination is increasingly looking like a three-man race between Trump, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. A second-place finish between the senators will help give them a leg up in the upcoming contests, although a third-place finish won't knock either of them out, either. ","Coming in behind Trump will allow the runner-up to present himself as the alternative to Trump. ","","Trump is going into South Carolina with strong numbers, but he took some risks by blaming former President George W. Bush for the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. ","\"The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush,\" Trump said Saturday during the CBS debate in Greenville. \"That's not keeping us safe. ... George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.\"","Trump's comments elicited a boisterous negative response from audience members in the hall and provided an opening for other candidates to criticize him. ","South Carolina is home to eight military bases and tens of thousands of veterans. Will Trump's outspoken assessment that their sacrifices in the wars of the past 15 years were part of a \"mistake\" hurt his appeal and soften his lead?","Also, will Trump's apparent support for the Iraq War in a September 2002 interview with Howard Stern -- which surfaced late Thursday and seemed to contradict his oft-repeated claim that he opposed the war since before it began -- hurt him with voters?","\"Yeah, I may have,\" Trump said in a CNN Republican presidential town hall hosted by Anderson Cooper when asked if he had signaled to Stern that he was in favor of invading Iraq. \"By the time the war started I was against it. And shortly thereafter, I was really against it.\"","He added that at the time he \"was not a politician.\"","","Bush has poured just about everything he's got in South Carolina. He's spent millions. He flew in his family, including his mother and his brother, George W. Bush, who has remained off the campaign trail until now. While he was able to secure the endorsement from South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, other key GOP figures in the state have looked elsewhere: South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. Trey Gowdy, all influential leaders in the state, have endorsed Rubio.  ","Bush and his allies have set high expectations in the state by calling it \"Bush country,\" so a poor showing would reinforce the notion that he has failed to inspire the Republican electorate, especially after failing to come close to achieving top-tier results in Iowa and New Hampshire, where he came in sixth and fourth, respectively. ","Coming in a distant fourth in South Carolina will send him limping into Nevada, where the most recent CNN/ORC survey puts him at just 1%. ","Bush has said he intends to continue regardless of the results Saturday, but he's banking on a strong showing here."]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160219102019-ted-cruz-marco-rubio-donald-trump-composite-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.827277","count":"13","text":"Donald Trump","disambiguated":{"subType":["AwardNominee","AwardWinner","Celebrity","CompanyFounder","TVPersonality","TVProducer","FilmActor","TVActor"],"name":"Donald Trump","website":"http://www.trumponline.com/","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_Trump","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0cqt90","opencyc":"http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rv0ncIZwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Donald_Trump"}},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.683532","count":"19","text":"President George W.

The late justice's son, Paul Scalia, delivered Mass for his father.","\"God blessed Dad, as it's well known, with a love for his country,\" Paul Scalia said, his voice occasionally quavering. \"He knew well what a close-run thing the founding of our nation was. And he saw in that founding, as did the founders themselves, a blessing. A blessing quickly lost when faith is banned from the public square or when we refuse to bring it there.\"","Scalia added, \"He understood that there is no conflict between loving God and loving one's country, between one's faith and one's public service. Dad understood that the deeper he went in his Catholic faith, the better a citizen and public servant he became.\"","In the front section sat every sitting member of the current Supreme Court. Justice Clarence Thomas a close friend of Scalia and a longtime conservative ally on the bench, participated in the service, reading from the book of Romans. The four other Catholic members of the bench -- Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Samuel Alito, Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Sonia Sotomayor -- were joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. ",""],"secondary":["The last to arrive was Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a longtime family friend of Scalia, who once said they were an \"odd couple\" and he counted her as his \"best buddy\" on the bench. Retired Justices John Paul Stevens and Justice David Souter were there. Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was unable to attend.","In the front section sat Vice President Joe Biden, who served for years on the Senate Judiciary Committee chairing confirmation hearings of federal judges, and his wife, Jill. Former Vice President Dick Cheney -- a friend and hunting companion of Scalia's -- also sat in the front section.","The incense-filled basilica hosted former clerks; Scalia had more than 100. As tradition holds, they stood vigil over the casket Friday and into the night at the Supreme Court.","One of the most prominent attendees was Paul Clement, a former clerk who served as solicitor general during George W. Bush's presidency. Another former solicitor general, Ted Olson, who has argued several cases before the court including Bush v. Gore, was present.","The current solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, also was present, as were White House counsel Neil Eggleston and Attorney General Loretta lynch.","Texas senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz -- who served as a clerk to former Chief Justice William Rehnquist -- took a break from the campaign trail to mourn. ","\"As Ronald Reagan was to the presidency, so too was Antonin Scalia to the U.S. Supreme Court,\" Cruz told CNN after the funeral concluded. \"Justice Scalia has been a personal hero of mine, virtually my entire life.\"","Cruz reiterated his belief that a nomination to replace Scalia should wait until the next president takes office.","\"It has been 80 years since the Senate confirmed a Supreme Court nominee who was nominated during an election year and we should not start now,\" Cruz said. \"We have an election in just a few months and I think the American people should be able to choose the direction of this court.\"","Michael Carvin, also a frequent Supreme Court advocate who has cases before the Supreme Court this term, also was in the audience. A group of federal judges arrived together, including three -- Sri Srinivasan, Patricia Millett and Merrick Garland -- who are considered possible nominees to replace Scalia.","Not attending, however, was President Barack Obama, a decision that has been criticized by some Republicans. GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Saturday tweeted, \"I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!\"","Obama, however, along with first lady Michelle Obama, members of Congress and more than 6,000 mourners, did pay respects to Scalia as his casket laid in repose at the Supreme Court building on Friday.","The Scalia family has announced a memorial program to be held March 1."]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160220100847-scalia-funeral-february-20-2016-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.840091","count":"23","text":"Antonin

But backlash against Beyonce started almost immediately after the superstar singer's release of her controversial \"Formation\" music video and Super Bowl 50 halftime show performance earlier this month.","Critics have objected to the #BlackLivesMatter themes in both, and specifically to her backup dancers at the halftime performance being outfitted in Black Panther-like costumes. ","In one portion of the music video, a young African-American boy wearing a hoodie dances before a line of police officers wearing riot gear before the words \"Stop Shooting Us\" appear in graffiti on a wall.","\"To taint police officers globally in the Super Bowl is really wrong,\" said Sgt. Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association in New York City.","CNN's Darius Johnson, Sheena Jones and Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report."],"secondary":["Mullins said the boycott, which he supports, would involve officers refusing to work paid off-duty security for the event, not refusing to perform regular law enforcement duties.","\"I can guarantee that if Beyonce needs help anywhere, police would respond,\" Mullins said, adding that he is concerned that even though \"she is in a major position to do things that are positive\" she is pitting herself against law enforcement.","\"She made a statement and now law enforcement is making a statement. What's clear is that no one in the country is trying to resolve the issues between communities of color and the distrust of law enforcement,\" he said. ","Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was also a vocal critic of the halftime show, telling CNN's Don Lemon that he found it emotionally offensive. Giuliani also said the singer should use her celebrity to encourage people \"to respect the uniform, not to make it appear as if they are the enemy.\"  ","Representatives for the Stop Mass Incarceration Network disagreed, arguing that celebrities like Beyonce have a right to speak out against police brutality without being attacked. ","A statement released by the group, founded in part by Dr. Cornel West in 2011, said, \"At a time when people have been rising up against the genocidal tide of police terror and mass incarceration in ways we haven't seen since the 60's, backward fascist reactionaries like Rudolph Giuliani and various national police organizations have unleashed a torrent of abuse attacking Beyonce and accusing her of 'cop killer entertainment.'\"","But Mullins said that when celebrities like Beyonce and public officials make statements against law enforcement, it makes officers' jobs more dangerous. He says they have seen more assaults on law enforcement due to anti-police sentiment.","The National Sheriffs' Association blamed Beyonce's \"anti-police 'entertainment'\" performance for four officer deaths last week. And after shots were fired outside his home this week, a sheriff in Tennessee held a news conference saying Beyonce's video may have provoked the shootings.","Later, in a Facebook post, Rutherford County, Tennessee, Sheriff Robert Arnold said his comments \"reflect the violence and senseless killing of seven deputies in the U.S. since the show aired. My comments are an observation of the violence that has occurred but in no way is meant to offend anyone.\"","The executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations pledged the group's support Friday for the boycott. ","\"Why would any group of working men and women support a rich celebrity who openly glorifies murderers?  Why would anybody?\" asked the group's executive director, Bill Johnson. ","The Massachusetts Police Association said it is just beginning to discuss the issue of the boycott, while other police unions are starting to hold meetings to decide how they will handle the situation. ","Frederick Frazier with the Dallas Police Association in Texas said the group is discussing the possibility of joining the boycott.","\"We are very happy that our brothers and sisters in blue are boycotting anyone who tarnishes the image of law enforcement,\" Frazier told CNN. \"And when she (Beyonce) comes to Dallas, she needs to know that the anti-police message is not welcomed. We respect anyone's First Amendment rights, but we also respect our officers and any law-abiding citizens (and) we will not respect those who tarnish our profession.\"","Joe Gamaldi, the vice president of the Houston Police Officers' Union in Texas, said the group wants more information before deciding whether to join the boycott. ","\"It is not needed until she explains her video and whether there is an anti- police address/message she is trying to bring to the public,\" Gamaldi said.","In a statement, Javier Ortiz, president of the Miami Fraternal Order of Police, accused the singer of using her recent Super Bowl performance \"to divide Americans by promoting the Black Panthers and her anti-police message.\"","Ortiz wrote Thursday that he \"was one of the tens of thousands of law enforcement officers that didn't watch the Super Bowl halftime show of respect for our profession,\" but that \"on another day while flipping through the television channels, I did mistakenly watch her 'Formation' video.\"","A representative for Beyonce was not immediately available to comment. But a spokesman for the Miami Police Department told The Huffington Post that the union spoke only for itself and that \"there's no indication that anything that is said there will translate into police officers not working the job.\"","\"The smartest thing for everybody to do is to find a table and sit down and to create an atmosphere and programs that benefit children and police officers, to rebuild trust and change a culture that is now in existence,\" Mullins said, offering to work with Beyonce to build such programs."]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160208122753-beyonce-super-bowl-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.803853","count":"10","text":"Beyonce"},{"type":"FieldTerminology","relevance":"0.442512","count":"7","text":"law

Trump on Friday cited an apocryphal story about a U.S. general who purportedly dipped bullets in pigs' blood to execute Muslim prisoners a century ago in an effort to deter Islamic terrorism."],"med":["Speaking at a rally in North Charleston, South Carolina, Trump reiterated his claim that the U.S. should \"go much further\" than waterboarding suspected terrorists, telling the story of Gen. John Pershing in the Philippines, who Trump said captured 50 Muslim prisoners a century ago and dipped 50 bullets in blood.","When your neighbors think you're a terrorist","\"And he lined up the 50 people and they shot 49 of those 50 people, and he said to the 50th, you go back to your people and you tell them what happened -- and in 25 years there wasn't a problem,\" Trump said to the audience, which grew quiet as he told the story.","Coming in contact with swine is forbidden under Islamic law.",""],"secondary":["The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about what Trump was suggesting in referencing the story, which Snopes, a website that investigates urban myths and legends, was unable to corroborate a year ago.","Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called the story \"bizarre\" during an appearance on NBC's \"Today\" show Saturday morning.","\"I'm sure people are offended. We hope people are offended by that. That's not what the United States is about,\" Rubio said.","Later Saturday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a leading Muslim civil rights group, said Trump's \"rhetoric has crossed the line from spreading hatred to inciting violence.\"","\"By directly stating that the only way to stop terrorism is to murder Muslims in graphic and religiously-offensive ways, he places the millions of innocent, law-abiding citizens in the American Muslim community at risk from rogue vigilantes,\" the group said in a statement. \"He further implies that our nation should adopt a strategy of systematized violence in its engagement with the global Muslim community, a chilling message from a potential leader. We pray that no one who hears this message follows his gospel of hate.\"","Muslim Advocates, another Muslim civil rights group, said Trump's comments \"are abhorrent and simply have no place in the American public forum. We urge all Americans of good conscience to come together and rise above hate and extremist rhetoric that only serves to divide us at a time when we must stand together.\"","","Trump's story took place during a rally in which the GOP front-runner reflected on his campaign's unanticipated success.","\"This all began June 16. Who knew this was going to happen? I figured maybe I'd be in the pack,\" a subdued Trump said as he began his final rally before South Carolina's Republican primary on Saturday, which could hand Trump his second consecutive electoral victory. \"I thought it was going to be like a horse race. I'd be in the middle of the pack and at the very end I'd inch it out.\"","In South Carolina, big leads on both sides","But Trump isn't in the middle of the pack, ready to inch out a victory in South Carolina. He's leading it, with CNN's average of South Carolina polling showing Trump with a double-digit lead over his closest competitor, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. The victory would be a momentous one for Trump and a blow to several of his opponents, including Cruz, who has positioned himself as the conservative capable of rallying the South to capture the nomination.","At Friday's rally, Trump ripped Cruz as someone \"who lies more than any other human being I have ever seen\" and slammed politicians broadly as \"all taken care of by every industry.\"","And while Trump touted his 20-point victory just a week earlier in the New Hampshire primary, he also sought to undercut his supporters' -- and the media's expectations -- urging them not to look at the polling showing him poised to clutch a decisive victory, but instead to get out and vote like they were preparing for a nail-biter.","\"Who knows what the numbers are. The polls are very nice. Who knows? We can't take a chance,\" Trump said in comments starkly in contrast with his predictions of a \"tremendous victory\" in Iowa the day he ultimately faltered with a second-place finish.","\"It's crunch time, folks. It's crunch time,\" he reminded the audience.","But Trump ended the night on a reflective note, reminding his supporters that they are part of a movement of which he is simply the \"messenger\" -- and urging them to get out and vote.","\"You're going to say to yourselves this was one of the greatest evenings and one of the great days of your lives,\" Trump said.","\"We're going to make America great again. Thank you, everybody. I love you.\" "]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160220081555-donald-trump-february-19-2016-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.860979","count":"30","text":"Trump"},{"type":"StateOrCounty","relevance":"0.236869","count":"5","text":"South Carolina","disambiguated":{"subType":["Location","PoliticalDistrict","AdministrativeDivision","GovernmentalJurisdiction","USState"],"name":"South Carolina","website":"http://www.sc.gov","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Carolina","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.06yxd","geonames":"http://sws.geonames.org/4597040/","opencyc":"http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rvViphZwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/South_Carolina"}},{"type":"Organization","relevance":"0.17696","count":"2","text":"Muslim Advocates"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.166381","count":"2","text":"Sen.

had the wildest, most fantastical imagination in art history -- painting our deepest fears, our deepest desires. "],"med":["500 years after his death, he is finally being accorded an honor almost certainly unthinkable during his lifetime -- a retrospective in his home city of s-Hertogenbosch (better known as ' Den Bosch' -- or the Forest) in the south of the Netherlands. A mere 16 years into the new century, one British art critic has already hailed the exhibition one of the most important of our time.","Like a later Dutch master, Vermeer, Bosch didn't leave us much -- just 25 paintings and 25 drawings. But the small municipal Noordbrabants Museum has managed to borrow most of them (20 paintings, 19 drawings -- everything pretty much except \"The Garden of Earthly Delights,\" his best known surviving work), even though it had nothing to lend in return. ","","The museum's director Charles de Mooij was astounded by the generosity of his museum colleagues, their desire to share and increase the public's knowledge of Bosch. ",""],"secondary":["Paintings have come from the Louvre in Paris, the Prado in Madrid, the Accademia in Venice, the Metropolitan in New York and the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Many have been freshly conserved, altar triptychs thrillingly reunited. These are works that originally hung in churches, monasteries and royal and ducal palaces.","Bosch gave us the stuff of nightmares, things and people impaled, all manner of beasts. A King's Librarian (to Phillip II of Spain who collected Bosch after his death) described the work as \"a satire in paint on the sins of men\" and so it clearly is. ","","In this case, the devil is literally in the detail. The manically inventive imagery, the bestiary has evidently continued to feed the modern imagination. ","Critics habitually draw parallels with Dali and Magritte and Francis Bacon. George Lucas was apparently inspired by Bosch when he dreamt up some of his aliens for \"Star Wars.\" ","The American thriller writer, Michael Connelly has long regarded Los Angeles as being a contemporary \"Garden of Earthly Delights\"; he named his L.A. police detective Harry \"Hieronymus\" Bosch.  ","Charles de Mooij wouldn't be drawn on the subconscious affect of the imagery. \"I'm not a psychologist,\" he said with a laugh. He suggested perhaps that from the 20th century onwards, we began to impose our ideas on Bosch rather than the other way around.","Mooij sees Bosch as an absolutely singular artist, hugely admired by his contemporaries and patronized by Church and nobility. He was a committed Catholic -- a member of an influential Christian brotherhood in his hometown with its 30 churches. We know that he came from a large family of painters: his father, his grandfather, his uncles, his nephews -- almost all of them painted. But Bosch's gifts set him apart.","","He was a story-teller, depicting Everyman as pilgrim on his journey to death. The works were intended as conversation pieces, making the viewer ponder on their own weaknesses and sins. Fundamentally, Bosch was putting the fear of God into his fellow man. ","Be warned -- take care of your eternal soul.","Mooij estimates some of the major works may have taken as long as a year to paint. And Bosch worked at a certain disadvantage. Time was relatively short. Like all good Christians, he wouldn't have painted on Feast Days -- and they accounted for almost a third of calendar.","After close infrared study, particularly of the drawings, Mooj marvels at how vividly and quickly Bosch worked. \"You can see he was always changing, constantly changing.\" There is something quiksilver about him. He changes his mind, has another idea with the paint still wet.  Finally, in the anniversary year of his death, Hieronymus Bosch is getting the same level of scholarly study long afforded his immediate Italian contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci.","The exhibition at the Noordbrabants Museum -- \"Hieronymus Bosch: Visions of Genius\"  -- runs thru May 8th before moving to the Prado in Madrid where it will join Bosch's work '\"The Garden of Earthly Delights.\""]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160218094930-hieronymus-bosch-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.937963","count":"14","text":"Den

The crinkling of scripts mixes with the hum of crew members ironing costumes and makeup artists adding final touches."],"med":["Cast members polish their characters in front of mirrors, perfecting movements. The curtain rises in an hour on the first episode of \"Saturday Night Live in Arabic.\"","In the shadow of the Pyramids of Giza lies Studio Misr, Egypt's oldest production house. A large marquee broadcasts the show's name in lights. The recently renovated studio smells of wet paint from the night's sets. ","The cast is as humble as they are funny. For many, this is their first time doing comedy. They are young; ranging between 19 years old to their mid-30s. The oldest staff member is 41. Some appear insecure about their new roles, but that evaporates in front of the live studio audience.","At a glance, there is not much that is funny about the current state of the Middle East. Civil war rages in multiple countries, ISIS' tentacles spread across the region, and millions of refugees flock to Europe. ",""],"secondary":["But cast member Shadi Alfons says there is \"way more to this part of the world than what people see in the news.\"","He says he and fellow cast member Khalid Mansour are an example: \"We are just a couple of bald, idiot comedians who try to get on TV and make people laugh about things we shouldn't make them laugh about.\"","","One sketch opens with twin babies in the womb, trying to determine where they are going to be born. ","First they think Sweden and they'll be rich and successful. ","Then they realize their skin color is darker so they think maybe Italy or Spain. ","Listening to the conversation in the room, they hear Arabic and think they'll be rich in Dubai. ","Finally, they hear a very Egyptian word and freak out, refusing to be born.  ","The show won't shy away from the region's mounting problems, but hopes to tackle them with a unique sense of humor.","\"We are trying to do something original. We aren't trying to break taboos but like one the way we do but not intentionally,\" explains Mansour. \"We are trying to make it suitable for a Middle East audience.\" ","Even the terror group ISIS is fair game. \"SNL in Arabic\" is pointedly referring to them by the derogatory Arabic name, Daesh."," \"They get pissed off from [being called] Daesh, so we say Daesh,\" Mansour adds. \"It's quite different if you know that enemy and know all the inside information that could give you the upper hand to make people laugh.\"","","It took two years of planning to get the show on air. ","The Cairo version will follow the original \"Saturday Night Live\" satirical sketch comedy model, codified in the SNL bible for franchises around the world. ","Last May, several members traveled to New York to meet the original show's cast.","\"They had 40 years of figuring it out and to write it in one format book,\" says Alfons. \"It's just a matter of finding the right content for our audience and tweaking the jokes so they are relevant and funny to the entire Middle East.\"","There will be weekly celebrity hosts. The premiere's guest is one of the region's biggest movie stars, Egyptian actress Donia Samir Ghanem.","They'll also have the other \"SNL\" mainstays of sketches, digital shorts, the news with \"Weekend Update,\" and live performances.","Three members of the New York cast -- Pete Davidson, Taran Killam and Aidy Bryant -- posted a video wishing their Egyptian colleagues well.","\"Welcome to the 'SNL' family and good luck!\" they say. \"Bye! Later!\"","\"We done? Yeah, good luck. ... They are doomed,\" adds Killam.","\"It's going to be tough, it's a tough job,\" says Bryant.","It is a tough job. \"SNL in Arabic\" puts on two shows a week with a quarter of the staff of the parent show. While they do a one-take performance in front of a live studio audience, the show isn't broadcast live for technical reasons. ","They hope that will change soon. ","","\"It is hell, (Davidson, Killam and Bryant) were right about that,\" says Yara Fahmy, one of the four female cast members. \"It's an amazing kind of hell.\"","Fahmy worked a desk job before auditioning with hundreds of other Egyptians to make the final cut of 12 cast members.","She admits she didn't know about the original \"Saturday Night Live\" before her audition.","\"I went online and looked it up then I started binge watching 'SNL.' I was totally in love,\" she says. \"Kristen Wiig, she is amazing. Every character she does is different. She just appears and people start to laugh. So confident.\"","\"SNL in Arabic\" isn't the first satire show in the Middle East.","\"'ElBernameg' set the tone for this kind of comedy. It was satire, political and social,\" says Mansour. \"It kind of set a bar for everyone to try to meet. We are trying to live off that legacy.\" ","\"ElBernameg\" rose out Egypt's 2011 revolution.","Host Bassem Youssef, was dubbed the Middle East's Jon Stewart. Alfons and Mansour both worked on the groundbreaking program that boasted a weekly audience of tens of millions of people across the Middle East. ","But in July 2013, the military overthrew one of the main targets of Youssef's satire, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy. When Youssef applied the same sharp wit to the country's new rulers, the show was quickly taken off air. Bassem Youssef now lives in self-imposed exile.","WATCH: Bassem Youssef crashes CNN","The new comedy show will appear on OSN, a private, paid satellite service in the Middle East that is known for its lack of censorship.","\"'SNL' will ruffle some feathers for sure, but we will always be respectful to our cultural identity. One can criticize without prejudice,\" says OSN's EVP of programming and creative services, Khulud Abu Homos. \"It's a thin line sometimes, but we are determined to make sure a balance is set between edgy comedy and responsible comedy.\"","Mansour and Alfons also know the red lines firsthand.","\"We can't really push so hard we repel people. We have to build a fan base and foundation first,\" explains Alfons. \"We still push the envelope, and by some people's standards that's not cool. But we will crush them.\"","\"No,\" Mansour interrupts. \"That's a little bit ISIS-y, don't say that.\""]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160218111415-08-cairo-snl-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.801127","count":"7","text":"Khalid

with a fully poseable skeleton, interchangeable faces and penetrable orifices starting at $6,500. The company says it rarely pays for advertising, relying on word of mouth and a steady stream of press coverage since its first celebrity endorsement: shock jock Howard Stern in 1996. ","Photographer Robert Benson discovered the factory last year. He had been searching for a sex-doll manufacturer to photograph during a visit to Japan. Much to his surprise, one of the most famous manufacturers was just a few miles from his San Diego home.","During a shoot in April, Benson captured the process of making a single doll from mold to makeup, and he met the team of nine that produces 300-400 dolls a year.","\"Everyone was super passionate about what they're doing, and they take the work seriously,\" Benson said. \"I guess the fascination wears off after a week and it becomes like any other job.\"","Robert Benson is a photographer based in San Diego. "],"secondary":["A single doll takes about 80 hours to make, starting with a silicone mold. After fingernails and nipples are shaped and painted, hair is added and makeup artists complete faces to a customer's specifications. Then the dolls are dressed and packaged in crates for shipping. ","The standard RealDoll comes in 18 female body styles and two male styles with five skin tones and 39 available faces. The standard line also includes transgender bodies with male or female anatomy. ","Custom orders start at $12,000 and depend on a client's imagination and budget: blue skin, green fish-like scales, fangs, elf ears, you name it. A popular request is for dolls resembling movie stars, the company says. While it cannot replicate a celebrity without express consent from the star or appropriate trust, it can approximate the look with the right face, body, hair and makeup. Another popular custom request is for male genitalia on a female body. ","Founder Matthew McMullen, a professional artist and sculptor, made his first life-sized mannequin in 1996 while working for a Halloween mask manufacturer. After posting a picture of it on the internet, he started receiving inquiries, he said, and it became evident there was a market for realistic and usable mannequins.","The manufacturing process has changed over time as technology has improved. RealDoll is now available in versions weighing 60 to 80 pounds, down from 75 to 115. Otherwise, the variety and range has always been as expansive as human tastes and desires, McMullen said. ","\"You can make a hundred thousand different varieties of the human form, and there's always going to be one more,\" he said."]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160209190442-01-cnnphotos-sex-dolls-tease-restricted-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.769086","count":"4","text":"Robert Benson"},{"type":"Company","relevance":"0.592842","count":"3","text":"RealDoll"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.57625","count":"3","text":"Matthew McMullen"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.436598","count":"1","text":"Howard Stern","disambiguated":{"subType":["MusicalArtist","AwardNominee","BroadcastArtist","Celebrity","FilmMusicContributor","FilmProducer","TVPersonality","TVProducer","FilmActor","FilmWriter","TVActor","TVWriter"],"name":"Howard Stern","website":"http://www.howardstern.com/","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Howard_Stern","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0sx5w","opencyc":"http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rvn6cnJwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Howard_Stern","musicBrainz":"http://zitgist.com/music/artist/e2714df1-4613-4dee-8e0e-f4f333200914"}},{"type":"Company","relevance":"0.396832","count":"1","text":"Abyss Creations"},{"type":"City","relevance":"0.360974","count":"1","text":"San Diego","mapLink":"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=San%20Diego&zoom=12&size=300x300&maptype=roadmap&key=AIzaSyD68KmxQFlbJuxJ6r2DLBBNmK4aY7z5xpo"},{"type":"Country","relevance":"0.337039","count":"1","text":"Japan","map":"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=Japan&zoom=4&size=300x300&maptype=roadmap&key=AIzaSyD68KmxQFlbJuxJ6r2DLBBNmK4aY7z5xpo"},{"type":"Holiday","relevance":"0.332377","count":"1","text":"Halloween","disambiguated":{"subType":[],"name":"Halloween","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halloween","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.03lq2","opencyc":"http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rvVjgHpwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Halloween"}},{"type":"JobTitle","relevance":"0.316931","count":"1","text":"Founder"},{"type":"Quantity","relevance":"0.316931","count":"1","text":"80 pounds"},{"type":"Quantity","relevance":"0.316931","count":"1","text":"80 hours"},{"type":"Quantity","relevance":"0.316931","count":"1","text":"$12,000"},{"type":"Quantity","relevance":"0.316931","count":"1","text":"$6,500"}]},{"numberOfSimilarities":1}],[{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","articleData":{"title":"Virgin Galactic unveils new spaceship","content":"<br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392089501/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db7601f/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392089501/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db7601f/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392089501/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db7601f/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392089501/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db7601f/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392089501/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db7601f/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392089501/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db7601f/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392089501/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db7601f/sc/28/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392089501/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db7601f/sc/28/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392089501/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db7601f/sc/28/ach.htm\"><img src=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392089501/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db7601f/sc/28/ach.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247392089501/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db7601f/sc/28/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/247392089501/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db7601f/sc/28/a2t2.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4db7601f/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/>","published":"2016-02-20T17:09:49.000Z","author":"","link":"http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4db7601f/sc/28/l/0Ledition0Bcnn0N0C20A160C0A20C190Cus0Cvirgin0Egalactic0Enew0Espace0Eplane0Cindex0Bhtml0Deref0Fedition/story01.htm","feed":{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","link":"http://edition.cnn.com/index.html?eref=edition","name":"CNN.com - Top Stories"}},"parsedData":{"nouns":["virgin","spaceship"],"verbs":[],"adjectives":["new","galactic"],"adverbs":[],"rest":["unveils"]},"pharagraps":{"main":[" (CNN)Virgin Galactic's race to become the first major private space tourism company just got closer to reality."],"med":["After more than three years of construction, Richard Branson's company unveiled a new spaceship Friday at the Mojave Air & Space Port in California. It is a replacement for the one that crashed in 2014, killing a test pilot.","Physicist Stephen Hawking named the new vehicle Virgin Spaceship (VSS) Unity in a recorded speech and on Twitter. ","\"I would be very proud to fly on this spaceship,\" Hawking  said.","Branson said the new vehicle means space can be made accessible in a way that has only been dreamed about before. ",""],"secondary":[" \"Our beautiful new spaceship, VSS Unity, is the embodiment of that goal and also a great testament to what can be achieved when true teamwork, great skill and deep pride are combined with a common purpose,\" Branson said, according to a company press release.","On Thursday, the company said that because of the fatal crash, the new spaceship will not \"blast off and head straight to space\" anytime soon. Instead, it faces an extensive testing period.","Once the craft has fully checked out, Virgin Galactic plans to use it to ferry passengers up 50 miles above Earth's surface -- a height the company said will qualify them as \"bona fide space tourists.\""," \"One of the things that I think is most powerful is that we'll be able to get a new perspective on our planet as hundreds and eventually millions of people are able to go into space,\" said George Whitesides, the company's CEO. "," More than 700 people have signed up to fly on Virgin Galactic -- even though the company requires $250,000 up front for a seat. ","So when will passenger flights begin? The company's tweets and press release are noticeably short on dates. But here are some of the key things that Virgin Galactic said will happen next:","•         After the ground tests are done, the spaceship will be flown on the back of its mothership, WhiteKnightTwo.","•         Next comes glide testing: The craft flies like a glider from an altitude of 45,000+ feet (8 miles) while pilots test its handling.","•         Rocket-powered test flights are next, each flight going a little higher and a little faster. When it crosses 100,000 feet (19 miles), the spaceship will be above 99% of the atmosphere and the pilots will experience weightlessness.","•         When it reaches 50 miles (80 kilometers), the pilots will have met NASA and the U.S. Air Force's requirements for official astronaut status, and they will be recognized by the Virgin Galactic team and by the U.S. government as bonafide space travelers.","The company said it has made many updates to the craft -- the most important being the feather inhibitor. The plane's feathers are a critical component of its reentry system. The accident that occurred in 2014 was a result of the feathers being prematurely being unlocked. ","\"The actual accident itself was caused by a control being moved when it shouldn't have,\" said Dave Mackay, the chief pilot for Galactic. \"We've implemented a new system, which prevents that from ever happening again.  So it's physically impossible to move that control at the point that it was moved during the accident.\"","While some of their competitors' ships, such as New Shepard from Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, don't have pilots and instead rely on automation, Virgin Galactic's system is entirely dependent on the skill of its pilots.","\"The pilots are controlling what the vehicle does at any stage,\" Mackay said. \"It's all dependent on the pilot.\"","Mackay said this strategy was pursed by the company for simplicity: \"The responsibility is high. But the reason that we've done it in the first place is to keep everything as simple as possible. The rationale is if you have a simple system, it's less likely to fail, and is therefore inherently safer.\"","Becoming a member of Virgin's elite pilot corps is no easy feat.  Virgin has five pilots, whose resumes all have the \"right stuff\" -- military, commercial, and test flying experience. Mackay himself has flown over 140 different types of aircraft.","When asked what it takes to be a Virgin Galactic pilot, Mackay said, \"We look for the most experienced test pilots that we can get. Test flying is important, because we're in the test and development phase of the vehicle.  And we're doing something which is unique.  It's very, very unusual.\"","Virgin's pilots also undergo intense training, using a sophisticated simulator until the spaceship is operational.","And while it will never be quite the same as actually being in space, Mackay said the time in the simulator is extremely valuable: \"This is as close as you can get to actually recreating it. You can't simulate the high G forces that we will feel during the rocket motor burn.  And of course you can't simulate the extended zero G experience.  You couldn't do that in any simulation sort of device.  But this is a hugely valuable tool for practicing flying the vehicle, how you operate it, how you operate it efficiently, and how the systems work, and what to do if a particular system or component might fail.\""," And not only is the simulator work valuable for pilot training, but it also helps with the actual spaceship design process:  \"A lot of the the work that we've done improving the vehicle, and developing the vehicle is done in the simulator first of all.  And then if we like what we've seen in the simulator we incorporate it in the actual vehicle itself.\""," Even when Virgin Galactic finally takes up its first passengers, it won't be the first time civilians have gone to space.

A third inmate, Robert King, was linked to Miller's death, but never charged.","The group became known as the \"Angola 3,\" and the case has been a cause celebre for years, with activists arguing there is no evidence tying the three men to the crime and decrying the decades they each spent in solitary confinement.","Samuel D'Aquilla, district attorney for Louisiana's West Feliciana Parish, told CNN that he was \"not really in agreement\" with the decision to release Albert Woodfox, but said \"it was probably the best thing to do,\" given the difficulties posed by a new trial. ","\"A lot of the witnesses (from Woodfox's 1973 murder trial) are now dead,\" he said.  \"I'd like to say for the record, he is a murderer.

He only experienced a few days of freedom; he was suffering from terminal liver cancer and died just days later.","The Angola 3 case spurred the creation of the International Coalition to Free the Angola 3 and drew the United Nations into the fray. Several U.S. lawmakers have pointed to the case as a sign that reforms are needed in Louisiana's prison system.

This conclusion is in line with U.S. intelligence determinations that al-Baghdadi sees the relatively lawless, impoverished North African state as prime ground to enlarge his self-declared caliphate.","The group has asserted itself in Libya by taking over territory and exercising terror, as evidenced by its beheadings of Egyptian Coptic Christians about a year ago on a Libyan beach.","Libya has also been a base to train militants, devise plots and launch them in places like neighboring Tunisia, which has been considered the Arab Spring's success story but has not been immune to the violence wrenching the region.","The Bardo Museum and Sousse beach attacks are gut-wrenching proof of that, not just because of the human carnage but also for their negative effects on a Tunisian economy that's long benefited from tourism.","Both attacks were carried out by one terror cell whose members came from Tunisia, communicated with ISIS leaders in Syria and Iraq, and trained in Libya, a Western counterterrorism source said. That training happened near Sabratha, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east of the Tunisian border where the Friday morning strike took place. ","The same cell planned to attack France's diplomatic complex in Tunis, only to be thwarted as Tunisian security forces moved in, according to the source. ","All of its roughly half dozen core members -- at least those not killed in attacks -- who were still in Tunisia are now in custody. But others involved in the plots may not be in the country, possibly finding refuge in their former training ground in Libya instead.","","It's no surprise the United States would help Tunisia. Last May, President Barack Obama cemented America's strong ties by designating the country as \"a major non-NATO ally.\"","A few weeks ago, Obama's top military adviser talked about stepping up efforts to curtail ISIS specifically in the North African country.","Addressing reporters while traveling in Europe, Gen. Joseph Dunford, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, said the United States wants to \"take decisive military action\" to \"check\" ISIS in Libya."]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160219084702-isis-fighters-in-libya-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Country","relevance":"0.857415","count":"11","text":"Libya","disambiguated":{"subType":["Location","GovernmentalJurisdiction","MilitaryPost"],"name":"Libya","geo":"27.4

on record in the Southern Hemisphere slammed straight into Fiji late Saturday, delivering the first crushing blows of a pounding that is expected to last for days on the tiny island nation. "],"med":["The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated Tropical Cyclone Winston's winds reached 184 mph in the hours before it made landfall about 7 p.m. Saturday (2 a.m. ET). ","\"Winston was a monster of a cyclone,\" Fiji resident Nazeem Kasim told CNN. \"I have not experienced anything like this before in my life, nor has my 60-year-old father.\"","The worst of the storm then went back out to sea, but only after wreaking havoc on the tourist hot spot with heavy flooding, rain and damaging winds. It could still end up hitting the South Pacific nation even more over the coming days.","The Fiji Broadcasting Corp. reported that an elderly man was killed when a roof fell on him. ","CNN's Brandon Miller, Archith Seshadri and Tina Burnside contributed to this report."],"secondary":["There are no other reports of fatalities, and the full extent of the damage \"is yet to be ascertained,\" according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). ","The government announced on Twitter that more than 750 evacuation centers had been activated. ","Photos shared on social media with the hashtag #PrayForFiji showed an idyllic paradise beset by flooded streets, roofless houses and downed palm trees.  ","\"It was an awful night with trees coming down,\" resident Alice Clements said. \"Everywhere I look, it looks like trees are down.\"","","Fiji, an archipelago collectively about the size of New Jersey, lies in the South Pacific Ocean some 1,800 miles from Australia's east coast (by comparison, Hawaii is about 2,500 miles from Los Angeles). Most of the nation's 900,000 residents live on one of two main islands: Viti Levu or Vanua Levu.    ","Although not hit directly, the capital of Suva endured \"damaging gale force winds, heavy rain and power outages,\" according to OCHA. ","Clements, who spoke to CNN from Suva, said she \"heard sounds of house roofs popping\" overnight. ","The Red Cross said it was \"fully prepared and on standby.\"   ","\"We are well-organized and prepared,\" said Eseroma Ledua, operations manager at the Fiji Red Cross. \"We have prepositioned relief items sufficient for 12,000 people in our headquarters in Suva and have mobilized over 300 staff and volunteers across our 14 branches nationwide.\" ","Widespread flash flooding and coastal inundation -- flooding in normally dry land -- \"is likely as storm surges may push the sea inland several hundred meters,\" the Red Cross said. ","Mudslides are a concern. ","\"This is a mountainous nation, and that means any heavy rainfall will filter down to the lower elevations -- meaning landslides, mudslides and flooding,\" said CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam. ","","Had it occurred in the Atlantic, Winston would have been a Category 5 hurricane, but because of hemispheric nomenclature, it's dubbed a cyclone. (In the Northwest Pacific, it would be a typhoon; all three are the same weather phenomenon).  ","No matter what you call it, Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama had his own name for it: an \"assault.\" ","\"As a nation, we are facing an ordeal of the most grievous kind,\" Bainimarama said. \"We must stick together as a people and look after each other.\"","Bainimarama, who said that the government is \"thoroughly prepared to deal with this crisis,\" declared a state of emergency that will be in effect for the next 30 days, according to the Fiji Times. ","","According to CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar, while Winston weakened as it moved over land -- as these types of storms do -- it has since reintensified, and with the El Niño-warmed water serving as fuel, Winston's eye has reformed. ","CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said Winston is expected to \"keep strength as it continues on its path in open waters,\" but said \"it will weaken Tuesday or Wednesday once it hits cooler waters and stronger shear.\" ","Winston's 184 mph winds smashed the previous record for a Southern Hemisphere cyclone.  According to Colorado State University hurricane expert Philip Klotzbach, both Cyclone Zoe, which battered the Solomon Islands in 2002, and Cyclone Monica, which walloped Australia in 2006, previously shared the record with their estimated winds of 178 mph. ","The most powerful such storm on record in any hemisphere was Hurricane Patricia, which was estimated to have hit 200 mph before petering out over southwestern Mexico in October.

The day of decision is just four months away."],"med":["Once the seat of a global empire on which, as it was said, the sun never set, the United Kingdom faces a stark choice: whether to continue to participate in the grand experiment called the European Union, or whether, in a sense, to pull up the drawbridge and stay home.","During marathon meetings in Belgium this week, British Prime Minister David Cameron wrung concessions from the reluctant leaders of the EU's 27 other countries. His country will have special status in the EU. If it stay in the EU at all.","Britain, it is now understood by all, will never commit to \"ever closer union,\" which has been the central goal of the EU and its predecessor organizations for decades. And it will not have to give child-tax credits or other financial aid to European Union citizens in financial distress for the first seven years, even when they come from other EU countries. ","So Cameron has won his country special status within the European Union. Now he has called a referendum for Thursday, June 23, to give voters the chance the Labor Party long denied them -- to go the the voting booth and, should that be their desire, tell the EU to shove it.","CNN's Anna Stewart in Brussels, Lindsay Isaac, Pierre Meilhan and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report."],"secondary":["The choice facing UK voters will be whether to have outsized global influence in situations such as those in Ukraine or Iran, by participating in a huge international organization, or whether or to go it alone, and retain a greater degree of sovereignty than participation an organization like the EU allows.","Cameron made it clear Saturday that he wanted Britain to remain in the European Union.","","\"Leaving Europe would threaten our economic and national security,\" he said. He pledged to campaign to persuade British voters to approve continued participation in the wake of his negotiations.","And George Osborne, the country's chancellor of the Exchequer, or chief financial official, said that leaving the EU -- something he and the Prime Minister had recently been threatening to do, as they negotiated with other EU leaders -- would be \"a huge leap in the dark\" that carried grave risks.","But the deal and the referendum has split their Conservative Party, and some of Cameron's own appointees will campaign against him.","The most prominent Conservative opponent he will face over the coming weeks is Justice Secretary Michael Gove.","Gove said Saturday that Britain would be \"freer, fairer and better off outside the EU,\" the BBC reported","He said his decision to defy the Prime Minister was the most difficult of his career.","But he said, as quoted on the BBC, that the EU had \"proved a failure on so many fronts,\" and he felt compelled to put his political convictions before loyalty to Cameron..","","At least four other members of the Cabinet are deserting the Prime Minister on the issue.","Cameron had promised in 2013 that he would renegotiate the terms of the UK's participation in the EU, then return to the British people to allow them the final say as to whether the UK should stay in the EU or withdraw from it.","The agreement in Brussels late Friday came only after two days of tense talks with other EU leaders. Cameron said the EU provided the concessions he sought, including assurances that the other nations won't try to make Britain part of a \"European superstate.\"","\"There will be tough new restrictions on access to our welfare system for EU migrants,\" he said. \"No more something for nothing. Britain will never join the euro, and we've secured vital protections for our economy and a full say over the rules of the free-trade single-market while remaining outside the euro.\"","","World leaders praised the deal, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying the EU leaders clearly wanted Britain to stay.","\"We believe we have now given a package to David Cameron to elicit support in Britain for Britain remaining a member of the European Union,\" she said. \"This was his goal after all. There was no doubt about it.\"","At the heart of the talks among the 28 EU heads of government were Britain's demands to play by special rules within the union. The demands left some EU leaders cold, but there was no great appetite to see a British exit from the EU -- or \"Brexit,\" as it has come to be known.","A British departure would leave the EU diminished. It would lose its second-largest economy -- behind only that of Germany -- and one of its two members with permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council. (France holds the other.)","Cameron was upbeat at his news conference, saying, \"our plan for Europe gives us the best of both worlds.\"","Britain will maintain full access to the EU's free-trade market and benefit from Europe-wide cooperation on crime and terrorism, he said. ","But it will not have to cooperate in \"the parts of Europe that don't work for us,\" such as the euro currency and eurozone bailouts, Cameron said.","","The EU sprang from the ashes of World War II as a free-trade zone. Its signal achievement has been to allow free movement of goods and people in the hope that economic integration would prevent a new continental war.","Britain opted out of both those EU provisions, and it views with skepticism the EU's effort to branch into new fields, regulating everything from pesticides to human rights, and creating a unified foreign policy, too.","Merkel said Britain's demand not to pay benefits to migrants from other EU countries had been a sticking point.","Cameron also wanted to opt out of the standard EU commitment that its members must work toward \"ever closer union\" -- a goal that has animated the European project for decades.","He wants Britain exempted from having to give various social benefits to newcomers -- even from other EU countries -- until they have lived in the UK for several years.","","Britain has resisted the envisaged \"ever closer\" ties with the EU. It is not a member of the Schengen Agreement, which allows passport-free travel among most European countries. And when many EU countries scrapped their national currencies in favor of the euro, Britain said it would stick with the pound. ","The country's difficult relationship with the EU is nothing new. In the 1960s, French President Charles de Gaulle not only opposed Britain's entry into what was then called the Common Market, he also opposed any negotiations on the topic.","Britain didn't join the European Community, as it was then called, until 1973, by which time de Gaulle was dead.","There's no assurance the British people will approve the referendum.","The historic number of people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and North Africa -- most of them bound for Europe -- increases the chances that Britons, fearful about their jobs and their national identity, will try to pull up the drawbridge and go it alone.","For his part, U.S. President Barack Obama had urged Britain to stay in the EU. The UK as a member of the EU \"gives us much greater confidence about the strength of the trans-Atlantic union,\" Obama said in July. ","Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said the agreement doesn't compromise \"our fundamental values.\"","\"I deeply believe that the United Kingdom needs Europe and Europe needs the United Kingdom,\" Tusk said. \"To break the link now would be totally against our mutual interest. We have done all we could not to let that happen. But the final decision is in the hands of the British people.\"","Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel tweeted: \"We overcame our differences to reach a good #agreement. Now up to British people to decide. Good luck @David_Cameron.\"","Cameron said economics wasn't the only reason to stay in the EU. Security was another issue, especially in the age of terrorism, Cameron said.","\"This, in my view, is a time to stick together, a time for strength in numbers,\" he said."]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160220094712-david-cameron-eu-deal-referendum-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Organization","relevance":"0.816606","count":"41","text":"European

kneels down to kiss his father's hand; a final blessing before the boy blows himself up in a truck full of explosives."],"med":["The disturbing goodbye was captured in a series of ISIS propaganda photos last month.","Supporters of the terror group claim the boy was used to help take the village of Ghazl near Aleppo, Syria.","But Omri is not alone. The use of child soldiers far predates ISIS, but what concerns researchers and policymakers is that ISIS' use of boys and girls does not follow the trends of previous conflicts.","ISIS does not use those under 18 because they provide specific technical advantage in combat or because they are short of fighters. Child soldiers are seemingly treated no differently than adult soldiers, according to a new study published Friday in the CTC Sentinel.",""],"secondary":["What this means in the self-proclaimed Islamic Caliphate is there simply is no sanctity accorded to childhood.","Mapping ISIS attacks around the world","","Researchers say that sad fact could not only have implications on the battlefield, as the chance for military encounters between coalition-backed forces and ISIS child fighters increases. ","The findings also show that eliminating ISIS will be much more complicated than killing its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, or disarming his fighters. There's the question of what to do about potentially thousands of indoctrinated children left behind.","Opinion: How to beat ISIS propaganda ","The cases of Omri and the 88 other children eulogized by ISIS in the past 13 months are documented in the study, which includes an open source database of ISIS child propaganda, the first of its kind.","\"What this database points to is the fact that use of children is far more normalized,\" Charlie Winter, the report's co-author, told CNN. \"They are not just being used to shock people in execution videos. They are being used for their operational value as well. This is something that sadly we have to expect to increase and accelerate as the situation becomes more precarious for ISIS in the years to come.\"","Researchers from Georgia State University have been combing Twitter and ISIS channels on Telegram to record the children's ages, dates, nationalities -- anyone 18 or younger. The trends are striking and deeply troubling.","Child soldier who escaped ISIS: 'Like coming back to life'","","Most of the children are from Syria. Most were killed in Iraq. Of the 89 cases, 39% died detonating a vehicle born IED device and 33% were killed as foot soldiers. Some 4% killed themselves while committing mass casualty attacks against civilians, and 6% died as propagandists embedded with brigades.","Researchers say they've noticed an emerging ISIS tactic. ","Nearly 20% of the children killed were inghimasis, or \"marauders\" who carried out so-called \"plunging attacks.\" That's a military operation in which a group of fighters attack an enemy position before blowing themselves up.","Last month, five adult ISIS fighters flanked by three children infiltrated the Tariq base in Iraq. ISIS boasted that the group attacked from within for three hours, killing people before detonating their suicide belts. Winter says this shows the children are not being used to replace adults. They are integrated into ISIS' military operations -- often with parental consent.","\"It's interesting the degree to which the parents are giving the organization access to their children,\" said Mia Bloom, the co-author of the report. \"It's not a coercive endeavor like what we saw in Africa. The kids are not being kidnapped. The kids are not being coerced. For the most part, what we're seeing is kids posing with a big smile and at least in one case saying goodbye to the parents.\" ","Mass graves, missing children","","ISIS has long made clear its intent to raise the next generation of jihadists, calling them the \"cubs of the caliphate.\" In a recent publication of their English language magazine Dabiq, it encourages mothers to sacrifice their sons for the self-proclaimed Islamic state.","\"As for you, O mother of lion cubs. ... And what will make you know what the mother of lion cubs is? She is the teacher of generations and the producer of men,\" the article reads. ","Winters says what is happening is very similar to how Saddam Hussein used child fighters in Iraq.","\"Even right down to the cubs of the caliphate, there was the cubs of Saddam,\" he said. ","\"ISIS is integrating children into its project in a way that is more reminiscent of a state than a non-state actor. It's thinking with the long term in mind. It's not just bringing children into its ranks and using them immediately on the battlefield. What it's doing is bringing them in, indoctrinating them, training them, spending a lot of time instilling them with jihadist ideology.\"","Bloom says the database of 89 children killed is a snapshot of a larger phenomenon. She estimates there are at least 1,500 ISIS child fighters, which poses unique challenges for the coalition on the battlefield and in terms of rehabilitation.","\"The way you got the kids out of child soldiering in Liberia, Uganda or Mozambique was you use two things. You use the family and you use religion,\" Bloom says. ","\"The problem with ISIS is that they've distorted the religion, and the families are colluding with ISIS to allow them access to the kids. So there's additional challenges, and we don't have a really good template to use ... it's a big problem.\""]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160112022612-iraq-isis-child-soldiers-elbagir-pkg-00021214-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Organization","relevance":"0.937502","count":"15","text":"ISIS"},{"type":"Organization","relevance":"0.246728","count":"5","text":"cubs"},{"type":"Country","relevance":"0.239619","count":"3","text":"Iraq","disambiguated":{"subType":["Location","GovernmentalJurisdiction","MilitaryPost","CityTown"],"name":"Iraq","geo":"33.0

","CNN's Archith Seshadri contributed to this report."],"secondary":["Though Eco was probably best known for his novels, he wrote and taught philosophy for many years, exploring such disciplines as semiotics and linguistics, among others.","He held positions at Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Northwestern, Cambridge, Oxford and the University of Bologna, according to his website.","\"I am a philosopher; I write novels only on the weekends,\" Eco told Britain's Guardian newspaper last year. \"As a philosopher I am interested in truth. Since it is very difficult to decide what's true or not I discovered that it's easier to arrive at truth through the analysis of fakes.\"","His book \"The Name of the Rose\" was adapted into a movie starring Sean Connery."]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160220122145-umberto-eco-2014-euro-gutenberg-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Company","relevance":"0.900243","count":"5","text":"Umberto Eco"},{"type":"Facility","relevance":"0.314474","count":"1","text":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"},{"type":"Facility","relevance":"0.26257","count":"1","text":"Premio Strega"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.246785","count":"1","text":"Bruce Nichols"},{"type":"Facility","relevance":"0.235031","count":"1","text":"Chevalier de la Légion"},{"type":"Organization","relevance":"0.196563","count":"1","text":"University of Bologna","disambiguated":{"subType":["Location","Facility","CollegeUniversity","University"],"name":"University of Bologna","geo":"44.49388888888889 11.342777777777778","website":"http://www.eng.unibo.it/PortaleEn/default.htm","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Bologna","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.01n1pp","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/University_of_Bologna"}},{"type":"Organization","relevance":"0.192434","count":"1","text":"American Academy of Arts"},{"type":"Organization","relevance":"0.181785","count":"1","text":"French government"},{"type":"Organization","relevance":"0.180557","count":"1","text":"Harvard","disambiguated":{"subType":["Location","CollegeUniversity","University"],"name":"Harvard University","geo":"42.37444444444444 -71.11694444444444","website":"http://www.harvard.edu/","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harvard_University","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.03ksy","geonames":"http://sws.geonames.org/4938981/","opencyc":"http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rvViyHZwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Harvard_University"}},{"type":"Country","relevance":"0.178609","count":"1","text":"Italy","disambiguated":{"subType":["Location","HumanLanguage","PoliticalDistrict","Region","AdministrativeDivision","GovernmentalJurisdiction"],"name":"Italy","geo":"41.9 12.483333333333333","website":"http://www.italia.it/en/home.html","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.03rjj","ciaFactbook":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/factbook/resource/Italy","opencyc":"http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rvVjMgZwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Italy"},"map":"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=Italy&zoom=4&size=300x300&maptype=roadmap&key=AIzaSyD68KmxQFlbJuxJ6r2DLBBNmK4aY7z5xpo"},{"type":"JobTitle","relevance":"0.175531","count":"1","text":"publisher"},{"type":"Organization","relevance":"0.16955","count":"1","text":"Yale","disambiguated":{"subType":["Location","FieldOfStudy","Company","AcademicInstitution","PeriodicalPublisher","CollegeUniversity","University"],"name":"Yale University","geo":"41.31111111111111 -72.92666666666666","website":"http://www.yale.edu/","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yale_University","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.08815","geonames":"http://sws.geonames.org/4846179/","opencyc":"http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rvViC4ZwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Yale_University"}},{"type":"Country","relevance":"0.16615","count":"1","text":"Britain","map":"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=Britain&zoom=4&size=300x300&maptype=roadmap&key=AIzaSyD68KmxQFlbJuxJ6r2DLBBNmK4aY7z5xpo"},{"type":"City","relevance":"0.151213","count":"1","text":"Columbia","mapLink":"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=Columbia&zoom=12&size=300x300&maptype=roadmap&key=AIzaSyD68KmxQFlbJuxJ6r2DLBBNmK4aY7z5xpo"},{"type":"City","relevance":"0.150797","count":"1","text":"Oxford","mapLink":"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=Oxford&zoom=12&size=300x300&maptype=roadmap&key=AIzaSyD68KmxQFlbJuxJ6r2DLBBNmK4aY7z5xpo"},{"type":"City","relevance":"0.148328","count":"1","text":"Northwestern","mapLink":"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=Northwestern&zoom=12&size=300x300&maptype=roadmap&key=AIzaSyD68KmxQFlbJuxJ6r2DLBBNmK4aY7z5xpo"},{"type":"City","relevance":"0.143088","count":"1","text":"Cambridge","mapLink":"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=Cambridge&zoom=12&size=300x300&maptype=roadmap&key=AIzaSyD68KmxQFlbJuxJ6r2DLBBNmK4aY7z5xpo"}]},{"numberOfSimilarities":1}]]
