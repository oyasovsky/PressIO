","Since 2012, Kariko has been creating amazing portraits of tiny monsters many Americans [live|alive|hot|bouncy|lively] with every day, including boll weevils, [carpet|rug|carpeting] beetles, moths, [wheel|bicycle|cycle|bike|pedal|] bugs, ants and earwigs.

","Not too many [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] are working with this kind of [approach|come near|set about|go about|border on], said Kariko, an assistant professor of [fine|finely|delicately|exquisitely|very well] art photography at East Carolina University.","The [result|leave|lead|ensue|resultant role] has been the creation of more than 50 images, many of which are stunning in their [color|colour|discolor|discolour|gloss] and [detail|contingent|particular|item|point]. ","That's what first attracted me to this, he said. With the naked [eye|eyeball|center|centre|middle], you see the insect as [brown|browned|brownish|chocolate-brown|dark-brown] [bug|wiretap|tap|intercept|tease].

","The [light|lightly|easy|loose|promiscuous] is inspired, he said, by paintings from some of the Dutch masters like Johannes Vermeer. ","It's a fun [project|externalize|externalise|send off|cast], most of all, Kariko said. They're meant to be [sort|classify|class|assort|sort out] of [tongue|clapper|spit|knife|natural language] in [cheek|boldness|nerve|brass|face]. ","In a nutshell, here's how he does it: ","Kariko may [happen|find|chance|bump|encounter] to [find|find oneself|recover|retrieve|regain] a dead insect at [home|home|interior|internal|national] or in his office. Choosing it as a candidate for a portrait, he'll [bring|fetch|bring in|lend|impart] it to a campus lab and [place|station|post|send|invest] it on a holder under a stereoscopic microscope with a digital camera mounted on [top|top|top off|crown|pinch] of it. ","Under LED lights, he'll [use|practice|apply|expend|habituate] tiny tweezers to [pose|perplex|vex|stick|get|puzzle] the insect. This takes a [steady|steadily|regular|firm|steadfast] [hand|pass|reach|pass on|turn over]. ","You have to [watch|determine|check|find out|see|ascertain] how much caffeine you have, to make sure you're very [calm|unagitated|serene|tranquil|sedate], Kariko joked. ","Next comes the really [cool|all right|fine|o.k.|ok] [part|partially|partly|in part|separate]. ","Kariko places the mounted insect into a [vacuum|vacuum-clean|hoover|vacuum cleaner|vacuity] [chamber|bedroom|sleeping room|sleeping accommodation|bedchamber] so it can be imaged under a scanning electron microscope. ","Scientists [use|practice|apply|expend|habituate] [scan|read|skim|rake|glance over]ning electron microscopes to [look|count|bet|depend|swear|rely] at some of nature's smallest objects. Traditional microscopes [use|practice|apply|expend|habituate] lenses to [magnify|blow up|enlarge|overstate|exaggerate] objects. Scanning electron microscopes [scan|read|skim|rake|glance over] objects with beams of particles called electrons -- which are smaller than atoms -- to [create|produce|make|] super-magnified images of very tiny things. ","Later, Kariko combines images from the two microscopes to [create|produce|make|] his final product. ","It takes 15 to 25 hours to make each photo, he said, depending on the insect. ","Coming [face|confront|present|front|look] to [face|confront|present|front|look] with insects that we [share|divvy up|portion out|apportion|deal] our homes and workplaces with might get a conversation going, Kariko said.

","Mapping ISIS attacks worldwide","It is significant that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi exerts more [control|master|see|check|insure] over the ISIS [branch|ramify|fork|furcate|separate] in Libya than any other, according to a [report|cover|describe|account|reputation] late [last|lastly|in conclusion|finally|last-place] year to the United Nations Security Council.

But we're also hungry for real solutions, Clinton said in her victory speech -- a not-so-subtle [jab|stab|prod|poke|dig] at Sanders for putting [forward|fore|ahead|onward|onwards] sweeping proposals including [free|loose|liberal|barren|destitute] college tuition for all, [free|loose|liberal|barren|destitute] healthcare for all and a national [hike|hike up|boost|raise|rise] in the minimum [wage|engage|pay|earnings|remuneration] to $15 an hour.","Sanders' promised programs didn't [carry|have a bun in the oven|bear|gestate|expect] the day with Nevada voters, and that's a problem for him. Nevada's minimum [wage|engage|pay|earnings|remuneration] is $8.25 (or $7.25 if the employer provides health insurance), meaning that a [jump|alternate|leap|pass over|skip] to $15 would [boost|advance|supercharge|promote|further] [wage|engage|pay|earnings|remuneration]s, in theory, by an [eye|eyeball|center|centre|middle]-popping 82%. But voters in Nevada -- including a ton of [lower|frown|glower|lour|depress]-[wage|engage|pay|earnings|remuneration] workers like [taxi|cab|hack|taxicab] drivers, [blackjack|blackmail|pressure|twenty-one|vingt-et-un] dealers, chambermaids and food servers -- chose Clinton, who favors a smaller [increase|step-up|increment|growth|addition] to $12 per hour.","Here's another way of looking at it. According to The New York Times, the [top|top|top off|crown|pinch] [issue|write out|make out|cut|emerge] for Democrats caucusing in Nevada is the economy and jobs, which was mentioned by one-third of respondents. If Sanders can't [close|closely|tight|near|nigh] the [deal|share|divvy up|portion out|apportion] with those kinds of voters in a [state|express|submit|put forward|posit] as economically troubled as Nevada, it suggests he may have a hard [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] selling his [program|programme|computer program|computer programme|course of study] in other parts of the country.","Sanders' slashing attacks on [Wall|wall|palisade|fence|fence in|surround] Street were also expected to [resonate|come across|vibrate] in Nevada, which led the nation in the [rate|value|rank|range|order] of foreclosures for five years in a [row|rowing|course|quarrel|wrangle] at the height of the recent housing crisis. But here again it was Clinton, who has accepted millions in speaking fees from [Wall|wall|palisade|fence|fence in|surround] Street investment firms, who succeeded with Nevada voters.",""],"secondary":["The truth is, we aren't a [single|single|undivided|exclusive|individual|unmarried]-[issue|write out|make out|cut|emerge] country, she said during her victory speech.  We [need|want|require|necessitate|ask] more than a [plan|design|project|contrive|be after] for the big banks. The [middle|center|halfway|middle|midway] [class|classify|sort|assort|sort out] [need|want|require|necessitate|ask]s a [raise|resurrect|upraise|lift|bring up].","Clinton's implication here -- a talking [point|repoint|sharpen|taper|target] repeated by many of her supporters -- is that Sanders is a one-[trick|flim-flam|play a joke on|play tricks|fob] pony with little to [offer|propose|declare oneself|pop the question|extend] beyond rhetorical attacks on banks and programs he won't be able to [force|storm|drive|ram|wedge] through a Republican-controlled Congress.","Together, we are going to [create|produce|make|] an economy that works for all of us and not just the [top|top|top off|crown|pinch] 1 percent, Sanders said in his concession speech -- a [line|trace|draw|describe|delineate] he uses in virtually every speech and media [interview|question|consultation|audience]. We have come a very [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful] way in nine months, he told his supporters. We have the momentum.","That's not as [true|admittedly|avowedly|confessedly|straight] today as it was before the Nevada caucuses. In recent weeks, Clinton has been in the awkward [position|put|set|place|pose|] of arguing that Sanders' [position|put|set|place|pose|]s are unrealistic, too pie-in-the-[sky|flip|toss|pitch] to ever get enacted. Americans are an optimistic [lot|distribute|administer|mete out|deal|parcel out] who [tend|be given|lean|incline|run] to [prefer|favor|favour|choose|opt] [hope|go for|trust|desire|Hope] over nope.

Sanders instead focused on the [March|border|adjoin|edge|abut|march] 1 Super Tuesday [contest|contend|repugn|competition] for a dozen far-flung states, including Texas, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Vermont, Wyoming and Georgia.","I [believe|trust|think|consider|conceive] on Super Tuesday we have an excellent [chance|casual|chance|find|happen|] to [win|earn|garner|succeed|come through] many of those states, Sanders said, predicting that the [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful] road to the national convention this [summer|summertime] [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] [culminate|climax] in one of the great political upsets in American history.","But that won't [happen|find|chance|bump|encounter] unless Sanders can [retool|] his [message|content|subject

We've made some real [progress|build up|work up|build|advance].  ","He struck an upbeat [tone|tone up|strengthen|inflect|modulate] and signaled that he was looking beyond South Carolina -- where Clinton is expected to [win|earn|garner|succeed|come through] -- to the Super Tuesday states.","We are [go|fail|go bad|give way|die]ing to be taking on a very well funded superPAC, he said. On Super Tuesday, we would very much like the [support|digest|endure|stick out|stomach|bear] of the American [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi]. We have received over 3.7 million in individual contributions, he added, directing [support|digest|endure|stick out|stomach|bear]ers to [go|fail|go bad|give way|die] to his website to [help|avail|serve|help oneself|facilitate] with additional contributions. Taking on the establishment, the financial establishment, the political establishment, the media establishment is not easy.

It's [clear|clearly|all the way|percipient|absolved] to me that the [wind|hoist|lift|wreathe|wind up] is at our backs, we have the momentum, he said to cheers. ","Nevada Democratic [Party|party|company|political party] spokesman Stewart [Boss|boss|brag|emboss|stamp|knob] estimated turnout at 80,000, falling [short|curtly|shortly|unawares|abruptly] of the nearly 120,000 voters who turned out in 2008. ","A [win|earn|garner|succeed|come through] by Sanders, who trounced Clinton in the New Hampshire primary, would have dealt Clinton a dramatic setback. The victory was a huge relief for Clinton and her allies, who were clearly rattled by what appeared to be an unexpectedly tight [race|rush|run|hotfoot|hasten] here in a [state|express|submit|put forward|posit] that was [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful] viewed as her firewall.","Beyond [name|diagnose|list|identify|discover] recognition, Clinton had enormous organizational advantages over Sanders -- not least of which was the fact that she began organizing some six months before the Vermont senator.","In a wild final week where Nevada polls showed Sanders pulling [even|yet|still|tied|level] with the former first lady, Clinton's [campaign|take the field|crusade|fight|press] pumped an additional half-million into its advertising [buy|bribe|corrupt|grease one's palms|purchase] on [cable|telegraph|wire|cable television|cable system], [broadcast|circulate|circularize|circularise|distribute|disseminate] and [satellite|planet|artificial satellite|orbiter] -- bringing her to parity with Sanders on the [air|vent|ventilate|air out|publicize], though she was already far [better|best|better|best|improve] known than her [rival|equal|touch|match|challenger].","Clinton also engaged in a furious [campaign|take the field|crusade|fight|press] [push|press|crusade|fight|campaign] in populous Southern Nevada, leaving nothing to [chance|casual|chance|find|happen|] [even|yet|still|tied|level] in the final hours before voters lined up to [caucus|].","In the days before the [caucus|]es, she far outpaced Sanders on the [campaign|take the field|crusade|fight|press] [trail|train|shack|chase|chase after] with a series of [stop|hold on|barricade|block|blockade]s on the Las Vegas [Strip|strip|undress|divest|disinvest|dismantle] to [appeal|invoke|attract|solicitation|collection] to [shift|switch|change|lurch|pitch] workers, visits to [labor|labour|toil|fag|travail]- and immigration-focused [even|yet|still|tied|level]ts and [even|yet|still|tied|level] a [surprise|storm|surprisal] [stop|hold on|barricade|block|blockade] at a Las Vegas [caucus|] [site|locate|place|web site|website] Saturday.","One [key|cardinal|central|fundamental|primal] to her victory: though the powerful Culinary Workers Union here stayed neutral, Clinton made an ardent [push|press|crusade|fight|campaign] to [win|earn|garner|succeed|come through] over their members (the union endorsed Barack Obama in 2008). She made an overnight [visit|chew the fat|shoot the breeze|chat|confabulate] to [meet|fitting|touch|adjoin|contact] with the housekeeping [staff|stave|faculty] at Caesar's Palace, stopped at a [uniform|undifferentiated|consistent|unvarying] department at one of the casinos and repeatedly went to casino employee dining rooms to make personal appeals to workers.","Those efforts clearly paid [off|away|forth|sour|turned]: She posted a strong performance at the six [caucus|] locations that were [set|hardened|determined|dictated|set] up for [shift|switch|change|lurch|pitch] workers on the Las Vegas [strip|undress|divest|disinvest|dismantle]. Minority voters, who tilted Clinton's way, turned out in strong numbers -- only about six in 10 [caucus|]-goers were [white|ashen|blanched|bloodless|livid] according to [exit|die|decease|perish|go|] polls.","She is the [best|better|better|best|outdo] person to [help|avail|serve|help oneself|facilitate] everybody -- on immigration, and with the children, said 55-year-old Ofelia Sanchec, a Caesar's Palace housekeeping worker as she stood in [line|trace|draw|describe|delineate] Saturday waiting to [caucus|] for Clinton with fellow employees. She is a lady, the first woman president. I [hope|go for|trust|desire|Hope] she [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] [help|avail|serve|help oneself|facilitate] us.","Asked whether she considered Sanders, Sanchec said no: For me, I [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] Hillary.","Repeating the [pattern|model|radiation pattern|radiation diagram|traffic pattern] of Iowa and New Hampshire, Nevada [exit|die|decease|perish|go|] polls showed that younger voters tilted heavily toward Sanders. The Vermont Senator carried more than 8 in 10 voters under 30, while Clinton carried two-thirds of those 45 and older.","But for some of those younger voters, like 29-year-old Vanessa McCallum, Saturday's decision was difficult [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] to the final moments, when she had to [decide|settle|resolve|adjudicate|make up one's mind] whether to [sit|seat|sit down|baby-sit|babysit] on the Sanders or Clinton [side|side|English|slope|incline] of the [caucus|] at Caesar's Palace.","It's a heart versus logic thing, said McCallum, a Las Vegas [massage|rub down|knead] therapist who ultimately caucused for Clinton. I [love|sleep together|roll in the hay|make out|make love] Bernie Sanders. And I [love|sleep together|roll in the hay|make out|make love] him because he's the only candidate who is enticing everybody -- the youth [vote|voter turnout|right to vote|suffrage|ballot] -- to get up, get out and do something. I [respect|honor|honour|abide by|observe] his policies. I [respect|honor|honour|abide by|observe] him as a person.","In the [end|terminate|stop|finish|cease], McCallum said, she questioned what Sanders would be able to [achieve|accomplish|attain|reach]. Voters across America, she said, are scared of the whole democratic socialist thing. ","I've always been curious to [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] how is he going to [guarantee|warrant|undertake|ensure|insure] that his next four years wouldn't be a [repeat|reprise|reprize|recapitulate|take over] of Obama and his struggles of the first four years with everybody filibustering everything that he does, McCallum said.","As she sat [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] with the Clinton contingent inside the [caucus|], she covered her eyes and said she [felt|felt up|mat up|matt-up|matte up] like she was cheating on Bernie, but that logic had won out.","Clinton relied on strong turnout from Latino voters to [hold|agree|concur|concord|declare] Sanders at [bay|quest|alcove|true laurel|bay laurel]. Her surrogates fanned out across the [Silver|eloquent|facile|fluent|silver|silver-tongued] [State|express|state|submit|put forward|posit] this week, attempting to [portray|present|impersonate|depict|limn] her as the more trustworthy candidate for Latinos.","In the final days, Clinton's allies slashed Sanders' immigration [record|register|read|show|tape], criticizing him as a Johnny-come-lately to the [issue|write out|make out|cut|emerge] who has been too vague about his plans.","At the same [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter], in Nevada's rural counties Clinton's canvassers pressed the [case|encase|incase|display case|showcase] that Sanders' proposals are unrealistic and unachievable in the current political climate.","Sanders emphasized his family's immigrant roots here in ads and on the [campaign|take the field|crusade|fight|press] [trail|train|shack|chase|chase after], noting that his [father|beget|get|engender|mother] came to America from Poland and originally spoke little English.","Immigration isn't just a [word|Bible|Christian Bible|Book|Good Book|Holy Scripture] for Bernie Sanders, the narrator said in one Spanish-language [radio|wireless|radio receiver|receiving set|radio set] ad for his [campaign|take the field|crusade|fight|press] in November. His story is the immigrant story.","But Clinton promised to make an immigration [overhaul|modernize|modernise|pass|overtake] [part|partially|partly|in part|separate] of her agenda in her first 100 days.","On Thursday, the same day that her [campaign|take the field|crusade|fight|press] [put|arrange|set up|order|place] an additional half million into their ad [buy|bribe|corrupt|grease one's palms|purchase], Clinton released an emotional immigration ad featuring the candidate talking to a tearful 10-year-old girl about the deportation [letter|varsity letter|letter of the alphabet|alphabetic character|missive] that her parents received. ","I'm going to do everything I can so you [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t have to be scared, she told the young girl in the ad, her [arm|build up|fortify|gird|sleeve] wrapped around her. [Let|lease|let|rent|get|have] me do the worrying. I'll do all the worrying. Is that a [deal|share|divvy up|portion out|apportion]? ","Meeting with workers, the former secretary of [state|express|submit|put forward|posit] stressed that she understood their struggles.","I [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] you do a hard [job|speculate|subcontract|farm out|caper], she told Caesar's Palace housekeeping workers during that overnight [visit|chew the fat|shoot the breeze|chat|confabulate] to their linen [room|board|way|elbow room] on Thursday after flying into Las Vegas from Chicago. She said that when she arrived at the hotel, she had asked herself: Who is still working?","A [lot|distribute|administer|mete out|deal|parcel out] of [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] are, she said, before asking the workers to [caucus|] for her."]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160215203748-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-composite-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.838986","count":"26","text":"Clinton"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.706237","count":"21","text":"Sen.

We were all blessed by her life and her [work|sour|turn|ferment|solve] as we are diminished by her passing, said Cathy Randall, a friend of Lee's for the past 30 years.","Flynt and Randall said they had recently visited Lee at the Monroeville assisted living facility where she had lived for several years because of declining health. Flynt said Lee was savagely witty.","She was still the most brilliant person in any [room|board|way|elbow room], Randall said.","It's common knowledge in Monroeville that Lee did not like to [talk|lecture|spill the beans|let the cat out of the bag|tattle] about Mockingbird.","Everyone in this community always respected that, [Green|fleeceable|green|gullible|unripe|unripened] told WIAT.","Though, in Lee's passing, she left behind a [question|wonder|interview|query|interrogate] about her [book|reserve|hold|Bible|Christian Bible] that might never be answered.

Similarly, her [support|digest|endure|stick out|stomach|bear] among those who [identify|discover|key|key out|distinguish] as [moderate|restrained|temperate|temper|season] also went up. In 2008, 46 percent of [moderate|restrained|temperate|temper|season] Democrats voted for her, compared to 43 percent for Mr. Obama. In 2016, she substantially increased the margin, winning 59 percent compared to Sanders' 37 percent.","Union members are a [key|cardinal|central|fundamental|primal] Democratic constituency in Nevada. This year 28 percent of [caucus|]-goers were from union households. Of those, 55 percent supported Clinton, compared to 43 percent for Sanders, an [increase|step-up|increment|growth|addition] over 2008. About the same percentage of union households attended the [caucus|]es that year, but Clinton [split|disconnected|disunited|fragmented|burst] the union [vote|voter turnout|right to vote|suffrage|ballot] almost evenly with Mr. Obama, 45 percent to 44 percent.","Clinton may have done well with some [key|cardinal|central|fundamental|primal] groups, but the data also [show|usher|read|register|record] that there are some warning signs on the horizon for the Clinton [campaign|take the field|crusade|fight|press]. Despite going to Nevada early and spending a good [deal|share|divvy up|portion out|apportion] of [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] there in comparison to Sanders, Clinton didn't [perform|do|execute] as well as she did eight years ago with a few demographic groups, in particular Hispanics, young [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi], and independents.","Sanders captured 53 percent of the Hispanic [vote|voter turnout|right to vote|suffrage|ballot] this year in [contrast|counterpoint|line|dividing line|demarcation] to Clinton's 45 percent. This represents a substantial [decline|slump|correct|go down|wane] in [support|digest|endure|stick out|stomach|bear] for Clinton among Hispanics compared to eight years ago. In 2008, Clinton got 64 percent of the Hispanic [vote|voter turnout|right to vote|suffrage|ballot], compared to Mr. Obama's 26 percent.","Clinton did not [win|earn|garner|succeed|come through] young [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] in either 2008 or 2016. But eight years ago she captured 33 percent of those under the [age|senesce|get on|mature|maturate] of 30, compared with just 12 percent in Saturday's [contest|contend|repugn|competition].","Nevada limits its [caucus|] to registered Democrats, but same-day registration is available. Among those [caucus|] goers who [identify|discover|key|key out|distinguish] as independent, Sanders did well, capturing more than 70 percent of the [vote|voter turnout|right to vote|suffrage|ballot], compared to Clinton's 23 percent. While Clinton lost independents to Obama in 2008, at that [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] she was able to [capture|catch|appropriate|seize|conquer] 33 percent to his 47 percent. As in the [case|encase|incase|display case|showcase] of Hispanics and young [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi], among this important constituency we see that Clinton's [support|digest|endure|stick out|stomach|bear] has dipped."]},"imageLink":"http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/02/21/3964d24e-7d00-4b73-9c78-c58ba2cd9f08/thumbnail/300x190/43eb038c3a9fd0d8284b7e0a862baaff/0220enschiefferchat698225492987640x360.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.845912","count":"31","text":"Hillary

","While at [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize], Curtis started a [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful] [distance|outdistance|outstrip|space|aloofness] relationship with Cory Didriksen. They met in high [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize], but only started dating when they left for college. She was studying communications at the University of Iowa.

A little bit of stubbornness, and she was a pistol and I loved her for that. I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] that was her most endearing quality, said friend Steve Belko.","Belko, Beth Dobrzynski and Bret Schrader grew up with Cory and Curtis in Quincy.  ","Curt was easygoing he was a gentleman, fun loving, intelligent - a gentlemen, said Belko.","[Do|do|dress|arrange|set|coif] you [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] they were well matched?

[Well|well|comfortably|advantageously|intimately|considerably], they looked great together, but they had a [lot|distribute|administer|mete out|deal|parcel out] of similarities and they seemed to have fun together, Dobrzynski replied.","It didn't take [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful] before their relationship became serious. ","It was Thanksgiving. We were sitting up on her [bed|go to bed|turn in|crawl in|kip down]. And we were just kinda talking about things and she said, 'Oh, by the way, I've met the [man|world|human race|humanity|humankind] I'm going to [marry|wed|tie|splice|get married],' said Didriksen.","","","In 1991, just one year after graduation, they were married.

","It was one of the [best|better|better|best|outdo] days, you [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out], in our lives, said Belko. ","Cory was beautiful. It was a great night.

Whether it was cutting the [cake|coat|patty|bar] or dancing or walking around and talking to [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi].  It was a magical night, Dobrzynski reminisced.","With Cory by his [side|side|English|slope|incline], Curtis Lovelace had grand plans. He attended law [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize] and eventually became an assistant [state|express|submit|put forward|posit]'s attorney in the city they both loved, Quincy.","What did Cory [want|need|require|desire|wish] to do with her life? ... What were her dreams? Maher asked Dobrzynski.","Cory was all about family. She had a great childhood growing up, she replied. She wanted the big family. ...The happy marriage.","","","That [dream|daydream|woolgather|stargaze|pipe dream] came [true|admittedly|avowedly|confessedly|straight] in 1993, when their first child, Lyndsay, was born. They would later have three sons: Logan, Lincoln, and Larson.","She was a beautiful person, Lyndsay Lovelace said of her [mother|beget|get|engender|father|].","Lyndsay, now 22, told KHQA reporter Jenny Dreasler how she and her [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] loved listening to the music [group|aggroup|mathematical group|radical|chemical group] ABBA.

In 2005, he opened up his [own|own|ain|have|possess] law [firm|loyal|truehearted|fast|fast] while still at the [state|express|submit|put forward|posit]'s attorney's office. Years later, he left to [concentrate|reduce|boil down|decoct|condense] on his [own|own|ain|have|possess] [practice|commit|apply|use|rehearse]. And, if his [schedule|agenda|docket] wasn't [busy|engaged|in use|interfering|meddlesome] enough, Lovelace was elected president of the [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize] [board|room|get on|gameboard|circuit board]. He became a [captain|headwaiter|maitre d'hotel|maitre d'|senior pilot] in the Illinois National [Guard|guard|defend|hold|ward|guard duty], and an adjunct professor at Quincy University.","He definitely was a pillar of this community, no [question|wonder|interview|query|interrogate] about it, Gough remarked.","But friends [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out] with [power|baron|big businessman|business leader|king], came ego. ","I just [felt|felt up|mat up|matt-up|matte up] he kinda started to [talk|lecture|spill the beans|let the cat out of the bag|tattle] [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] to me more and more each [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] I [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] him, said Schrader.","Was he arrogant? Maher asked.","He became arrogant more and more, yes, Belko said. There was a little bit of holier than thou. ...Maybe you were entitled to this living. I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] he lost friends over [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] because of that.","The situation at [home|home|interior|internal|national] had also been changing. While Curtis had spent years focused on his professional life, the [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful] hours away from Cory and the kids were starting to take a [toll|bell|price|cost] on their personal life.","From what we learned now, and he eventually admitted, they had a volatile relationship, said Gough.","Neighbors around the Lovelace [house|put up|domiciliate|theater|theatre] on Kentucky Street [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out] that in the months leading up to her death, they had heard loud and contentious arguments between Cory and Curtis. By many accounts, both were heavy drinkers. And in this small community, it was known that at times there was a tremendous [amount|come|add up|total|number] of turmoil in their [home|home|interior|internal|national].    ","She suffered from bulimia. This is something her family has admitted, Dreasler said. And the rumors started coming out. ...Known alcoholism. The community knew that too. There've been [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] who've [even|yet|still|tied|level] told me ... I [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] her out drinking here or out drinking there. [People|people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] knew that she had an alcohol problem, but I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] that they knew to the extent. ","","","Amazingly, Curtis and Cory managed to [keep|preserve|restrain|keep back|hold back] their problems from their closest friends, like Belko, who years before, had moved away from their small town.","Was there a [point|repoint|sharpen|taper|target] in [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] where any of you started to see things changing between the two of them? Maher asked the friends.","No, said Belko. ","No indication that there was [trouble|ail|pain|trouble oneself|bother] coming up? Maher asked.","I never had any, Belko replied. ","Cory was a great person, very confident, she had everything under [control|master|see|check|insure]. And she wasn't one to you [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] [whine|grizzle|yammer|yawp|squeak] or [complain|kick|plain|sound off|quetch], Dobrzynski said. She could [handle|wield|manage|palm|cover] it. ","But everything [fell|barbarous|brutal|cruel|roughshod] apart on Valentine's Day 2006, when Belko got a [call|predict|foretell|prognosticate|forebode] from Curtis's [father|beget|get|engender|mother] that Cory had died. ","He said, '[Listen|heed|mind|listen|hear|take heed] I got some bad news.' ...And I just couldn't [believe|trust|think|consider|conceive] it. No, that doesn't [happen|find|chance|bump|encounter]. She's my [age|senesce|get on|mature|maturate]. She's healthy. This just doesn't come from nowhere, Belko said. Something's [wrong|incorrectly|wrongly|faulty|incorrect]. There was no [doubt|dubiousness|doubtfulness|question|uncertainty] something is terribly [wrong|incorrectly|wrongly|faulty|incorrect].","On Feb. 14, 2006, [love|sleep together|roll in the hay|make out|make love] was in the [crisp|curt|laconic|terse|frizzly] [winter|overwinter|wintertime] [air|vent|ventilate|air out|publicize] of Quincy, Illinois. At 1869 Kentucky, it was a [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize] day and Cory Lovelace would usually have her hands [full|fully|to the full|wide|wide-cut].","Cory was a [stay|quell|appease|last out|ride out] at [home|home|interior|internal|national] mom, Gough explained. She was always hustling, always trying to get the kids wrangled around and to where they needed to be.","That morning seemed like so many others. According to Curtis Lovelace, Cory helped get the kids [ready|quick|ready|fix|prepare]. They had [breakfast|] and jumped in dad's car. It was 8:15 a.m.","Curtis then took the three oldest children to [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize], Gough said. They left the youngest, the 4-year-old, there.","And little 4-year-old Larson went upstairs to see his mom.","Went in and he said that he said her [name|diagnose|list|identify|discover] and he thought he poked her. But she didn't [answer|suffice|do|serve|resolve], Dreasler explained. So he ... sat and waited for his dad to get [home|home|interior|internal|national].","Then when he got [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards], the youngest was still there ... said something that he couldn't [wake|awaken|waken|rouse|wake up] his mom up, said Gough.","By then, it was about 9 a.m.","Curt went upstairs to [use|practice|apply|expend|habituate] the restroom and glanced [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards] in the bedroom and [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] something wasn't [right|correctly|aright|justly|wholly]. Went in to see Cory, tried to [shake|shake off|throw off|escape from|stimulate] her. And nothing, said Belko.","That was the moment a normal Valentine's Day morning turned into a mystery. Behavior turned suddenly strange, starting with Curtis Lovelace.","Took the youngest to Cory's [mother|beget|get|engender|father|]'s [house|put up|domiciliate|theater|theatre]. Gave the youngest child to Cory's [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] and said, 'Cory's dead' and left, Gough said. The first [call|predict|foretell|prognosticate|forebode] was not to 911. The first [call|predict|foretell|prognosticate|forebode] was not to the paramedics. The first [call|predict|foretell|prognosticate|forebode] was his [boss|brag|emboss|stamp|knob], the [state|express|submit|put forward|posit]'s attorney.","[Still|still|stock-still|even|yet|however] strikes you as odd, Maher noted.","Very much so, said Gough.","Who walks over to their [mother|beget|get|engender|father|]-in-law's [house|put up|domiciliate|theater|theatre], gives them their youngest ... and says, 'Your daughter's dead, here's my child. [Take|contract|take|get|drive|contain] [care|worry|manage|deal|handle] of him,' Maher commented.","The whole scenario was bizarre, said Gough.","Was Curtis Lovelace in [shock|traumatize|traumatise|offend|scandalize]? ","[People|people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] do [process|serve|swear out|work|work on] grief differently, sure. If it was my wife, I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] I'd have called 911 screaming and ranting and trying to [perform|do|execute] CPR, which he didn't do, said Gough.","The grim details of the day would be embedded in the minds of those who were there. E.M.T Cole Miller was among the first on the scene.","She was laying in the [bed|go to bed|turn in|crawl in|kip down] and her arms were drawn up by her chest, he explained, holding up his arms to [show|usher|read|register|record] how Cory's were positioned. And I went in there to [check|crack|break|chink|determine] for signs of life, [check|crack|break|chink|determine]ed her carotid [pulse|pulsate|throb|pulse rate|heart rate] in her [neck|make out|neck opening|cervix], and then [check|crack|break|chink|determine]ed her wrist and [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] that it was cold and stiff.","It was just surreal, said Dobrzynski.","When I did [find|find oneself|recover|retrieve|regain] out I was very shocked, said Schrader.","What happened in the [house|put up|domiciliate|theater|theatre] that morning, when it happened -- just how [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful] Cory Lovelace had been dead -- would be questions that would [haunt|frequent|obsess|ghost|stalk] a town and [destroy|put down|demolish|ruin|destruct] a family.","She'd been dead [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful] enough that there was no [need|want|require|necessitate|ask] to [start|protrude|pop|pop out|bulge] CPR. It wouldn't do any good, said Miller.","Quincy [Police|patrol|police|police force|constabulary|law] Detective Jeff Baird would not [speak|address|talk|utter|mouth] to 48 Hours. But that day he did [speak|address|talk|utter|mouth] with Curtis, who told his version of events -- a morning Curtis swears to [police|patrol|police force|constabulary|law] and to friends, Cory was still very much alive.","What did he [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out] happened? Maher asked Steve Belko.","That Cory had been ill the night before ... had thrown up and wanted some Tylenol and he got her some, he explained. Apparently she did come [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] to [help|avail|serve|help oneself|facilitate].  He told me he just remembers her at the [bottom|bottom|penetrate|fathom|freighter] of the steps, they walked out and he took the kids to [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize].","According to Curtis, his wife Cory was not feeling well that Valentine's Day morning. She came [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] the stairs and sat [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] for a while. Detective Baird said that three of the children also told him they [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] their [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] alive that morning.","He interviewed the three oldest children. Those interviews were not recorded, video or audio. He just took notes and then turned in a [report|cover|describe|account|reputation] in which he spoke to the three oldest children individually, without their [father|beget|get|engender|mother] being there. And they all told him they had seen their [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] that morning, said Gough. ","Why is the [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] Cory Lovelace died so critical?  [Ask|ask|ask out|invite out|take out|necessitate] a [man|world|human race|humanity|humankind] who deals in death for a living, Deputy Coroner James Keller. That Valentine's Day morning, he was there to [transport|transmit|transfer|channel|channelize] Cory's [body|personify|soundbox|consistency|consistence].","Upon entering the [bed|go to bed|turn in|crawl in|kip down]room, I [notice|acknowledge|comment|remark|point out] the female lying on the [bed|go to bed|turn in|crawl in|kip down] on her [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards] with her hands kind of in an upright [position|put|set|place|pose|], Keller explained.","[Can|displace|fire|give notice|can|dismiss] you [show|usher|read|register|record] me? Maher asked.","Hands kind of above her, he said, holding his arms up, elbows bent, in [front|front|breast|look|face] of his chest. Kind of this direction here ... a very odd [position|put|set|place|pose|].","However [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful] Cory Lovelace had been dead, to Keller it certainly appeared that medical rigor mortis had [set|hardened|determined|dictated|set] in -- a [process|serve|swear out|work|work on] he says usually takes [close|closely|tight|near|nigh] to 12 hours.","She was in the [state|express|submit|put forward|posit] of [full|fully|to the full|wide|wide-cut] rigor, said Keller.","[Full|fully|to the full|full|wide|wide-cut] rigor? Maher asked.","[Full|fully|to the full|full|wide|wide-cut] rigor, he affirmed.","Almost like a mannequin? Maher asked.","[Correct|right|correct|adjust|set|decline].","Fully stiff?","Fully stiff.","Keller was told that Cory [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] the kids [off|away|forth|sour|turned] to [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize], handing one a Valentine's [class|classify|sort|assort|sort out] [project|externalize|externalise|send off|cast]. And someone on the scene told Keller Cory Lovelace had died in the morning.","Keller's response to that was, What day?","Did it make any [sense|smell|smell out|feel|common sense] to you that they were saying it was that morning? Maher asked.","It did not, Keller said. It just didn't [seem|appear|look] to [add|total|tot|tot up|sum] up.","Over the years, James Keller has learned one undeniable truth of his [trade|deal|sell|swap|swop]: the dead do [speak|address|talk|utter|mouth].","A [body|personify|soundbox|consistency|consistence] always tells a story the way you [find|find oneself|recover|retrieve|regain] them, he said.","What is the story that Cory's [body|personify|soundbox|consistency|consistence] was telling you? Maher asked.","That she had passed earlier that prior evening or day, Keller replied.","Ten to 12 hours earlier, possibly?","[Correct|right|correct|adjust|set|decline]. Yes ma'am, Keller affirmed.","But that medical assessment of [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] of death wasn't matching what Curtis and the kids were saying -- that Cory has been alive that morning. ","It was just not what she was telling. It was just not what she was saying, said Keller.","Did you [tell|distinguish|separate|differentiate|secern|secernate] anybody about that afterwards and as the inquisition went on? Maher asked.","There's numerous [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] ... the coroner Gary Hamilton, he replied. ... everybody had some reservations, maybe concerns.","James Keller was a deputy coroner at the [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter], [second|secondly|2nd|2d|back] to sitting coroner Gary Hamilton, who was also at the Lovelace [home|home|interior|internal|national]. An [autopsy|necropsy|postmortem|post-mortem|PM], including toxicology [test|quiz|screen|prove|try], was conducted the day after Cory was [found|establish|base|ground|plant] dead, and Hamilton signed [off|away|forth|sour|turned].

","[Well|well|comfortably|advantageously|intimately|considerably] 'undetermined' ... if you [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t have a [cause|induce|stimulate|have|get] ... leaving it 'undetermined' was the [right|correctly|aright|justly|wholly] thing to do, said Keller.","Despite the odd [position|put|set|place|pose|] of Cory's arms and despite an unexplained [cut|thinned|weakened|slashed|emasculated] on her lip, two days later, at her [mother|beget|get|engender|father|]'s [request|ask for|bespeak|call for|quest], Cory Lovelace was cremated and Quincy [police|patrol|police force|constabulary|law] officially closed the investigation.","And life went on? Maher asked Gough.","Yeah, he said.","Nobody cared to [look|count|bet|depend|swear|rely] deeper?"," Nope.","Eight years would [pass|passing|pass|excrete|egest|eliminate], and then a curious [cop|collar|nail|apprehend|arrest|pick up] followed a [hunch|hump|hunch forward|hunch over|intuition].","You had a detective in the Quincy [Police|patrol|police|police force|constabulary|law] Department, Adam Gibson, Gough explained.","And lookin' at the photos ... and with -- with Cory's [body|personify|soundbox|consistency|consistence] bein' in that [condition|stipulate|qualify|specify|discipline], it just -- it just didn't make [sense|smell|smell out|feel|common sense] to me, said Det. Gibson.","Within six months after the mysterious death of his wife, Cory, on Valentine's Day 2006, Curtis Lovelace rekindled his [love|sleep together|roll in the hay|make out|make love] life and began dating a student in a [class|classify|sort|assort|sort out] he taught at Quincy University. The woman, named Erica, was eight years his junior.  They married two years later, but she and his then-14-year-old daughter, Lyndsay, didn't get along.  Lyndsay became estranged from her [father|beget|get|engender|mother].  ","Lyndsay, apparently, didn't have a [place|station|post|send|invest] in that family. Why, I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out], said Steve Belko.","Lyndsay then moved out of her [father|beget|get|engender|mother]'s [house|put up|domiciliate|theater|theatre] and in with her grandmother Marty Didriksen, Cory's mom. ","Curt chose his [second|secondly|2nd|2d|back] wife over his daughter, said Belko.","Marriage [number|keep down|count|enumerate|numerate] two [fell|barbarous|brutal|cruel|roughshod] apart in 2013.","But once again, Curtis Lovelace didn't [stay|quell|appease|last out|ride out] [single|single|undivided|exclusive|individual|unmarried] for [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful]. He got married for a third [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] months after his [divorce|split up|disassociate|dissociate|disunite] in 2013, this [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] to his current wife, Christine, whom he had known in high [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize] and reconnected with years later.","","","He is a funny, charming, sweet, kind, [compassionate|feel for|pity|condole with|sympathize with], wonderful [husband|conserve|economize|economise|hubby], she told 48 Hours.

","Sometimes it takes fresh eyes to see things, said Det. Gibson.","And I was at the office ... just reading old [case|encase|incase|display case|showcase] files, and the Lovelace [case|encase|incase|display case|showcase] popped into my [head|steer|maneuver|manoeuver|manoeuvre], he said.","The more Det. Gibson [read|understand|interpret|translate|register] about the 8-year-old [case|encase|incase|display case|showcase], the more he was intrigued.","What in that [file|file away|charge|lodge|register] made you [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out], 'Huh, I'm [go|fail|go bad|give way|die]nna [go|fail|go bad|give way|die] [find|find oneself|recover|retrieve|regain] the pictures and the hard [copy|re-create|replicate|imitate|simulate] of this [file|file away|charge|lodge|register]?

Gibson.","","","The pictures [show|usher|read|register|record] Cory's [body|personify|soundbox|consistency|consistence] in [bed|go to bed|turn in|crawl in|kip down] - lifeless, but with her arms bent at the elbows and bizarrely frozen in the [air|vent|ventilate|air out|publicize].  ","That didn't really make [sense|smell|smell out|feel|common sense], and there was no real explanation for 'em, said Det. Gibson.","Gibson consulted King County Coroner James Keller, who was the deputy coroner in 2006.","It bothered me for years, said Keller.","So when you [found|establish|base|ground|plant] out that Detective Gibson was moving [forward|fore|ahead|onward|onwards], what was your reaction? Maher asked.","I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] it -- it is definitely [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] to [open|candid|heart-to-heart|clear|capable], Keller replied.","Detective Gibson kept investigating the old [case|encase|incase|display case|showcase] secretly, out of the public [eye|eyeball|center|centre|middle].  He consulted the original pathologist, Dr. Jessica Bowman, who had ruled the death undetermined. Bowman told Gibson she would no longer [participate|enter|take part] in the [case|encase|incase|display case|showcase], but sent him for another opinion to another pathologist she knew in Chicago, Dr. Shaku Teas.","She said basically that she [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] nothing suspicious about the death, Det. Gibson said of Dr. Tea's ruling.","So why wasn't that the [end|terminate|stop|finish|cease] of it for you?  I [mean|bastardly|beggarly|mingy|miserly], you have Dr. Bowman who says undetermined, you have now Dr. Shaku Teas, who is accredited and is telling you, '[look|count|bet|depend|swear|rely] it's undetermined, I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t see a problem with it,' Maher asked the detective.","Because I didn't [believe|trust|think|consider|conceive] that the information that Dr. Teas had given was credible to what I already knew, he replied.","So Det. Gibson sought yet another opinion. [Enter|embark|enter|insert|infix|introduce] Dr. Jane Turner, an assistant medical examiner in St. Louis.  ","What do you [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of] as the first thing that struck you about that [file|file away|charge|lodge|register]? Was there anything in there that you looked at and said, '[Well|well|comfortably|advantageously|intimately|considerably], that's interesting,' Maher asked Dr. Turner.","Yes. It was the scene photographs ... the presence of rigor mortis and the [position|put|set|place|pose|] of the hands is unusual ... the hands weren't resting on a [surface|come on|come out|turn up|show up].  They were almost suspended in [air|vent|ventilate|air out|publicize], which tells me that there was ... an [object|aim|objective|target|physical object] that had been there previously that had been removed, she replied.","","","Could you [show|usher|read|register|record] me, [put|arrange|set up|order|place] ... my arms in the [position|put|set|place|pose|] that you [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] Cory Lovelace's [body|personify|soundbox|consistency|consistence] in while she was laying [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] still in the [bed|go to bed|turn in|crawl in|kip down]? Maher asked Dr. Turner.","So she was on her [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards]. And her arms were like this.  A little bit [lower|frown|glower|lour|depress] than that, she replied, positioning Maher's arms, as shown in the photo above.","And-- if they were stuck in this [position|put|set|place|pose|], they're in rigor-- what does that [tell|distinguish|separate|differentiate|secern|secernate] you at that [point|repoint|sharpen|taper|target]? Maher asked.","[Well|well|comfortably|advantageously|intimately|considerably], that more [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] has passed than the [witness|find|see|attestant|attestor] stated, Dr. Turner replied.","The [witness|find|see|attestant|attestor] being Curtis Lovelace, who said he had talked to his wife less than an hour before finding her dead. ","In my [report|cover|describe|account|reputation], I stated 10 to 12 hours. Rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours.  And with her arms in that [position|put|set|place|pose|], which -- with the -- the emergency responders coming in, they were still in that [position|put|set|place|pose|], suggests to me that she was in [full|fully|to the full|wide|wide-cut] rigor, said Dr. Turner.","Based on the photos, the [autopsy|necropsy|postmortem|post-mortem|PM] [report|cover|describe|account|reputation] and [police|patrol|police force|constabulary|law] [report|cover|describe|account|reputation]s, Dr. Turner pinpointed the [cause|induce|stimulate|have|get] of death: suffocation at the hands of another.","What did you [determine|check|find out|see|ascertain] would have caused the suffocation? Maher asked.","[Well|well|comfortably|advantageously|intimately|considerably], with the [position|put|set|place|pose|] of the hands, it suggests that there was an [object|aim|objective|target|physical object] between her hands and her [body|personify|soundbox|consistency|consistence].  ...And it appears that there is a [pillow|rest] missing, Dr. Turner replied. So I [suppose|presuppose|speculate|theorize|theorise] that a [pillow|rest] was used to [suffocate|gag|choke|strangle|stifle] her.","While Det. Gibson had a new timeline and a [cause|induce|stimulate|have|get] of death, he also had one big problem. [Remember|commemorate|remember|commend|think back|think of], the three oldest Lovelace children insisted they [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] their [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] alive that morning, sitting on the stairs.  ","The one thing I do [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] is, the science of Cory Lovelace doesn't [match|equal|equalize|equalise|equate] that story, said Gibson.","Gibson believes the children may have simply been mistaken. Maybe that's because they weren't interviewed by the original detective, Jeff Baird, until two days after their [mother|beget|get|engender|father|]'s death. But if Curtis Lovelace did [kill|obliterate|wipe out|toss off|pop] his wife the night before, as Dr. Turner believes, what was his motive? ","Was there a life insurance policy, Maher [ask|ask out|invite out|take out|necessitate] Gough.","...he said there was no life insurance, he replied.","Was he having an affair?","I have not heard that, said Gough.","So what's the motive? What does he [gain|put on|take in|clear|make]? Maher asked.","...he told one of the witnesses that their [last|lastly|in conclusion|finally|last-place] 90 days of their marriage hadn't been good, Gough replied.","[People|people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] [fight|crusade|press|campaign|push] and [argue|indicate|contend|debate|fence] all the [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter], Maher noted to Det. Gibson.","That's [true|admittedly|avowedly|confessedly|straight], he said.","How did it [lead|moderate|chair|run|precede] to [murder|mangle|mutilate|slay|hit] in this situation? Maher asked.","That's the million-dollar [question|wonder|interview|query|interrogate], Det. Gibson replied.","A new detective ... [found|establish|base|ground|plant] a [doctor|repair|mend|fix|bushel|] to [give|yield|afford|open|collapse] him the [answer|suffice|do|serve|resolve] he was looking for.  There's not one bit of [evidence|tell|testify|bear witness|prove] ... that Cory ... was murdered, said Christine Lovelace.","How certain are you now that Curtis Lovelace murdered his wife, Cory? ","I'm 100 percent certain. The science tells me that, said Det. Gibson.","In August 2014, eight years after the death of Cory Lovelace, Curtis Lovelace was leaving his law office at lunchtime when [police|patrol|police force|constabulary|law] confronted him - and arrested him for his wife's [murder|mangle|mutilate|slay|hit].","Nobody had any idea that this was, this was happening.  None of the local media, said KHQA reporter Jenny Dreasler.","","The same day as a grand jury indictment comes [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy], he's arrested in broad daylight, cuffed and stuffed [right|correctly|aright|justly|wholly] outside his law office and taken [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] to booking, said local journalist [Bob|bob|curtsy|dock|tail|bobsled] Gough.","A good friend who works for a news [station|post|send|place] in Quincy, he texted me ... said 'Christine, Curt's been arrested for Cory's [murder|mangle|mutilate|slay|hit],' Christine Lovelace told 48 Hours. I said,'that makes no [sense|smell|smell out|feel|common sense], Cory was not [murder|mangle|mutilate|slay|hit]ed.'","There was nothing to [prepare|train|develop|educate|groom] us for this, it was probably [worst|pip|mop up|whip|rack up] day of my life, she said.","The former golden boy would [spend|expend|drop|pass] the next 17 months in [jail|imprison|incarcerate|lag|immure|put behind bars], held on $5 million [bond|draw together|bind|tie|attach].  ","I was a little stunned, friend Steve Belko said. He looked old, haggard. Something I'd never seen before.","","","Curtis Lovelace pleaded not guilty, awaiting his trial until just over three weeks ago. ","A decade after Cory Lovelace's death, the [murder|mangle|mutilate|slay|hit] trial of her [husband|conserve|economize|economise|hubby] was about to [begin|start|lead off|commence|get down] at the Adams County Courthouse. After hearing all the [evidence|tell|testify|bear witness|prove], it may come [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] to just one [question|wonder|interview|query|interrogate] for the jury: [Do|do|dress|arrange|set|coif] they [believe|trust|think|consider|conceive] Cory's children, who [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out] they [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] their [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] alive that morning? Or do they [believe|trust|think|consider|conceive] two medical examiners who [insist|assert|importune|take a firm stand] the science [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out]s she was killed the night before?","Some of the jurors who would [decide|settle|resolve|adjudicate|make up one's mind] Curtis' [fate|destine|doom|designate|fortune] spoke with 48 Hours.","And by [show|usher|read|register|record] of hands, how many of you knew Curtis Lovelace and his family or knew of them prior to this? Maher asked the [group|aggroup|mathematical group|radical|chemical group].  Four of the six jurors raised their hands. OK, so a majority of who are here. ","Is it the trial of century in Quincy? Maher asked Gough. Yes, he replied.","And why is that, just because of who he is? ","Yes. Absolutely, Gough replied. I [mean|bastardly|beggarly|mingy|miserly], bigger they come, the harder they [fall|descend|settle|hang|flow].","Quincy was consumed with this trial on social media and in the coffee shops."," I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]' [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] the [case|encase|incase|display case|showcase] should've been brought to [start|protrude|pop|pop out|bulge] with ... all they got is circumstantial [evidence|tell|testify|bear witness|prove], no smoking guns, a resident  told 48 Hours.","The prosecution laid out its dramatic [case|encase|incase|display case|showcase] -- that Curtis Lovelace s[mother|beget|get|engender|father|]ed his wife, Cory, the [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] of his four children, with a [pillow|rest] the night before Valentine's Day.","Jurors heard from world-renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden and Dr. Jane Turner.  They both testified that Cory had to have died the night before.","It's the whole [picture|depict|render|show|visualize] -- she had drying artifact of her lips.  She had drying artifact of her eyes.  Again, something that develops with the passage of [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] after death, Dr. Turner told Maher. Rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours.  And with her arms in that [position|put|set|place|pose|] ... suggests to me that she was in [full|fully|to the full|wide|wide-cut] rigor.","The prose[cut|thinned|weakened|slashed|emasculated]ion uses Dr. Turner to [explain|excuse|explicate] how a [cut|thinned|weakened|slashed|emasculated] [found|establish|base|ground|plant] during the [autopsy|necropsy|postmortem|post-mortem|PM] on Cory's lip was caused by her being suffocated.","There's a [bruise|hurt|wound|injure|offend] on the inside of the lip and -- and with it a laceration. And that's from [blunt|crude|stark|candid|forthright] [force|storm|drive|ram|wedge] trauma.  So some [force|storm|drive|ram|wedge]ful [pressure|blackmail|blackjack|coerce|hale] was applied to the [mouth|talk|speak|utter|verbalize], she explained.","But then, in this [battle|combat|conflict|struggle|fight] of the experts, the defense counters with their [own|own|ain|have|possess], Dr. George Nichols.  He says Cory most likely died of causes related to an enlarged liver due to drinking and her bulimia.  ","I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] she died as a [result|leave|lead|ensue|resultant role] of natural diseases related to her liver disease. But the corroborative tests to [confirm|reassert|corroborate|sustain|substantiate] that were not performed, so I cannot come to that conclusion scientifically, said Dr. Nichols.","My opinion is, there's no [proof|proof|proofread|validation|substantiation] that this woman was murdered, he said.","And as to Dr. Turner's [claim|take|exact|lay claim|arrogate] that the degree of rigor mortis shows she had to be dead 10 to 12 hours?  ","As I said repeatedly in there, rigor mortis does not [occur|come|happen|hap|go on] at a specific, fixed [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter].  There's huge variability from person to person, Dr. Nichols stated. ","[Further|farther|further|promote|advance|boost], he said, Dr. Turner was only working from photos -- she never actually [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] Cory's [body|personify|soundbox|consistency|consistence] in person.  ","And as to that [single|single|undivided|exclusive|individual|unmarried] [cut|thinned|weakened|slashed|emasculated] on Cory's lip?  Nonsense, says Dr. Nichols.","That's eliminated, because she does not have sufficient injuries to the inner [surface|come on|come out|turn up|show up] of her lips, he told 48 Hours.","But she did have that one injury, a 48 Hours producer pointed out.","One. Not multiple.  How many teeth do I have? Dr. Nichols said, showing his teeth. OK?  Each of those is capable of making at least one, if not more, injuries to the inside of my lips as I'm fighting [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards] against someone who's holding a [pillow|rest] over me.","If the testimony of the dueling pathologists had jurors scratching their heads, it was in stark [contrast|counterpoint|line|dividing line|demarcation] to the testimony of the Lovelace boys, which clearly pulled at their hearts.","The kids [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] be in my [mind|bear in mind|beware|heed|listen] probably forever, said juror Theresa Tarr.","The prosecution called the youngest son, Larsen, who was 4 years old at the [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] of his [mother|beget|get|engender|father|]'s death, who recounts his story about poking mommy to [wake|awaken|waken|rouse|wake up] her up.  Juror Theresa Tarr was struck by the [image|visualize|visualise|envision|project|fancy].","It was an emotional testimony, she said. Thinking that a four-year-old mighta been pokin' his dead mom, it was very emotional.","My children have dealt with enough [pain|anguish|hurt|trouble|ail] in their life for them to [feel|palpate|finger|sense|find] any kind of [pain|anguish|hurt|trouble|ail], an emotional Christine Lovelace said.","Then, the defense called the two older sons, Logan, now 18, and dressed in his military [uniform|undifferentiated|consistent|unvarying], and Lincoln, now 17. A normally stoic Curtis breaks [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] when each of the two older boys takes the [stand|resist|fend|stand up|place upright], recounting how Curtis came to [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize] that day to [tell|distinguish|separate|differentiate|secern|secernate] them their [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] had died.","Both boys emphatically [tell|distinguish|separate|differentiate|secern|secernate] the [court|woo|romance|solicit|homage], they are 100 percent certain they [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] their [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] alive that morning. Logan said he [even|yet|still|tied|level] remembers asking his ailing mom if he could [stay|quell|appease|last out|ride out] [home|home|interior|internal|national] from [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize] to take [care|worry|manage|deal|handle] of her. ","There are [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] who have accused the kids of lying, that's not who the kids are, Christine  Lovelace said. Kids [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] [share|divvy up|portion out|apportion|deal] experiences as they [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] them, not what they're told to.","And then came Lyndsay, the final [key|cardinal|central|fundamental|primal] testimony for the prosecution. She was 12 at the [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] her [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] died, and now she's the [star|leading|prima|star|starring|stellar] [witness|find|see|attestant|attestor] at her [father|beget|get|engender|mother]'s trial.","So how important is Lyndsay's testimony? Maher asked Gough.","Oh, it's critical.  It's the whole ballgame, he replied.","[Up|up|upwards|upward|upwardly|up] until this trial, Lyndsay had always insisted she [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] her [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] alive that morning. But now, at [age|senesce|get on|mature|maturate] 22, and under oath in the courtroom, she says can't be sure about what she remembers from that day.","And I've had a [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful] [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] to [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] about that and it's almost frustrating not to [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of], because you [want|need|require|desire|wish] to, she said in an [interview|question|consultation|audience] with Dreasler.","And yet, immediately afterwards,  defense attorneys [show|usher|read|register|record] a [videotape|tape] made just two years earlier,  where Lyndsay tells Det. Adam Gibson she absolutely remembers seeing her mom alive that morning. ","In the [end|terminate|stop|finish|cease], if you can't, you can't [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of], she said. ...and just [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out], 'I'm sorry.

I can't definitively [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out] anything? Maher asked Det. Gibson.","Yeah.  You never [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] what anybody is gonna [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out], he replied.","Lyndsay changing her story, the testimony of her brothers, and the dueling medical experts -- it all had the jurors heads spinning.  ","She didn't [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of], and that, to me, was very hard.  Because two years earlier, she had given a statement to Adam Gibson, that she [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of]ed a [lot|distribute|administer|mete out|deal|parcel out], said jury foreperson Adam [Buss|snog|kiss|buss|osculate|osculation].","In the [course|naturally|of course|run|flow] of deliberations, I changed my [mind|bear in mind|beware|heed|listen], said juror Mike Hayden.","You [answer|suffice|do|serve|resolve] one [question|wonder|interview|query|interrogate].  But it spawns another [question|wonder|interview|query|interrogate], Maher noted.","[Right|correctly|right|aright|justly|wholly], another juror agreed.","On Feb. 4 2016, closing arguments [begin|start|lead off|commence|get down]. Curtis Lovelace, who has prosecuted cases in this very courthouse, walked in for the conclusion of his [own|own|ain|have|possess] [murder|mangle|mutilate|slay|hit] trial. His new wife, Christine, says the trial has taken a [toll|bell|price|cost] -- especially on Curtis' sons.","We [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] that everyday the [focus|focalize|focalise|sharpen|concenter] is bringing their [father|beget|get|engender|mother] and my [husband|conserve|economize|economise|hubby] [home|home|interior|internal|national], she said. It's so cumbersome to be raising a family while we're still doing all that we're doing. We're managing, it's difficult but we're managing.","For Det.

","I [want|need|require|desire|wish] [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] to [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of] Cory outta all this ... she deserves to have her day just like everybody else, he told Maher. The jury [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] [decide|settle|resolve|adjudicate|make up one's mind] if somebody took that life from her.","And you'll [live|alive|hot|bouncy|lively] with the decision, whatever it is? Maher asked.","Whatever it is, Det.

And if I'm not sure, I'm not sure a jury member is sure, Gough pointed out.","How many of you thought it boiled [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] to you either believed the kids, or you believed the science? Maher asked the [group|aggroup|mathematical group|radical|chemical group] of jurors. All six raised their hands.  ","Going [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards] on the hands thing, that was the most debated thing in that deliberation [room|board|way|elbow room], as far as I'm concerned, juror Adam [Buss|snog|kiss|buss|osculate|osculation] said. I [mean|bastardly|beggarly|mingy|miserly], we had jury members on the [floor|deck|coldcock|dump|knock down|], you [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out], just - 'How do we [lay|laic|secular|put down|repose]?  How you [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out], do we [hold|agree|concur|concord|declare] the covers?'","Jury members got on the [floor|deck|coldcock|dump|knock down|] -- [put|arrange|set up|order|place] themselves in this [position|put|set|place|pose|] like this. To [try|try on|render|strain|stress] and [figure|calculate|cipher|cypher|compute] it out, Maher commented.","[Right|correctly|right|aright|justly|wholly], said [Buss|snog|kiss|buss|osculate|osculation].","And did that [help|avail|serve|help oneself|facilitate]?  Did the [show|usher|read|register|record]-and-[tell|distinguish|separate|differentiate|secern|secernate] of it [help|avail|serve|help oneself|facilitate] you?"," It did.  But it--it almost left more questions than answers, he said.","","Meanwhile across town, Lyndsay Lovelace -- estranged from her [father|beget|get|engender|mother], stepmother and brothers -- awaited the verdict from the [comfort|ease|soothe|console|solace] of the [home|home|interior|internal|national] she shares with her grandmother.","Yeah, we [need|want|require|necessitate|ask] a verdict. We [need|want|require|necessitate|ask] some kind of [closure|cloture|closedown|closing|shutdown] -- some kind, said Steve Belko."," And hopefully the boys, the family, the grandparents--that everybody can get [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards] together again someday [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] in the future, said Beth Dobrzynski.","If [found|establish|base|ground|plant] guilty, Curtis Lovelace could [spend|expend|drop|pass] the [rest|pillow|perch|roost|reside] of his life behind bars. ","I haven't gotten a [lot|distribute|administer|mete out|deal|parcel out] of [sleep|kip|slumber|log Z's|catch some Z's] in the [last|lastly|in conclusion|finally|last-place] year-and-a-half. Every minute is spent thinking about what we could we be doing ... with the goal of bringing Curtis [home|home|interior|internal|national] and proving his innocence, said Christine Lovelace.","After 16 1/2 hours of jury deliberations over two days, Lyndsay received that much anticipated [call|predict|foretell|prognosticate|forebode].","Breaking news here inside the Adams County Courthouse. [Judge|judge|adjudicate|try|pronounce|label] Hardwick did just now [declare|adjudge|hold|announce] a mistrial, Jenny Dreasler reported.Curtis' current wife could be seen sobbing ... the three Lovelace boys all holding hands before that verdict was reached.","","","It was unreal and ... I [felt|felt up|mat up|matt-up|matte up] so [empty|empty-bellied|hollow|vacuous|evacuate] and out of [breathe|emit|pass off|rest|catch one's breath] and the only thing I could do was [hug|embrace|bosom|squeeze|clinch] my kids and [let|lease|rent|get|have] them [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] it is going to be OK and it is going to be OK, Christine Lovelace said of the jury's decision.","This is just dragging it out more. But if they're hung, they're hung. And there's nothing we can do about it. We just [wait|waitress|expect|look|await] for the next [round|around|orotund|rotund|pear-shaped], Lyndsay said of the outcome. ","It's [set|hardened|determined|dictated|set] for retrial.  And we [plan|design|project|contrive|be after] to [retry|] it, said Prosecutor Ed Parkinson.","If there's no new [evidence|tell|testify|bear witness|prove], how do you [paint|rouge|blusher|key|pigment] it in a different [light|lightly|easy|loose|promiscuous] and not [put|arrange|set up|order|place] yourself in a [position|put|set|place|pose|] of a hung jury again? Maher asked. ","Maybe not [paint|rouge|blusher|key|pigment] in a different [light|lightly|easy|loose|promiscuous].  Might [paint|rouge|blusher|key|pigment] it in the same [light|lightly|easy|loose|promiscuous] and with a different jury, he replied.","But this jury fought until the [end|terminate|stop|finish|cease].","Did it ever [become|suit|turn|go|get] contentious? Maher asked the six jurors.  ","It did. I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve], probably five of the jurors said, 'There is no way anybody is ever gonna [change|deepen|transfer|exchange|interchange] my [mind|bear in mind|beware|heed|listen].' And two of those, I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve], were for guilty, three for not guilty, juror Mike Hayden said. And that just deflated me so much. ","Joyce ... you [believe|trust|think|consider|conceive] he did it? Maher asked.","I [believe|trust|think|consider|conceive] he did it, said Stevens.","He's not guilty.  And they didn't [prove|raise|leaven|rise|test] it to me, said Tarr.","I had a feeling, after that first day, we weren't gonna come to a unanimous decision, said Stevens.","We're stuck, Maher noted.","It was pretty -- it was pretty obvious, Stevens affirmed.","Steve, do you [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] that Curt killed Cory? Maher asked Steve Belko.","I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out]. I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t wanna [believe|trust|think|consider|conceive] it. Because everything I [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] about Curt, he could not have [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]e it. And -- I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t [even|yet|still|tied|level] [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] if it would've been [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]e in a crime of passion, he replied. I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] of Cory on that. Because I [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] Cory is -- is one tough cookie. She'd have fought to the death to [defend|maintain|represent|champion|fight] her children.","I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t [hear|listen|take heed|try|learn] anyone in this little triad saying, 'No way, no how, he didn't do it,' Maher said to the Lovelace's friends. There's nobody here pounding their fists saying, 'My friend didn't do it.'","I wouldn't [go|fail|go bad|give way|die] that far. I'm not entirely sure, said Belko.","I wouldn't [go|fail|go bad|give way|die] that far, either, said Beth Dobrzynski.","It's definitely [put|arrange|set up|order|place] a huge [question|wonder|interview|query|interrogate] in my [mind|bear in mind|beware|heed|listen]. Was there something-- some [reason|argue|reason out|conclude|cause] she died other than natural causes, said Bret Schrader.","As the entire town awaits this new trial, speculation and [gossip|chew the fat|shoot the breeze|chat|confabulate|confab] [continue|cover|extend|stay|stay on].","The [question|wonder|interview|query|interrogate] everyone has: what does the future [hold|agree|concur|concord|declare] for Curtis Lovelace?","How does he get his life [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards] ... in his hometown? said Gough.","Because in the [court|woo|romance|solicit|homage] of public opinion, you [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] always [feel|palpate|finger|sense|find] like he did something, said Maher.","Yeah.  Yeah. And again when this ends ... I just [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t see how he's gonna be given the [benefit|do good|profit|gain|welfare] of the [doubt|dubiousness|doubtfulness|question|uncertainty], said Gough.","Christine Lovelace says she [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] never [stop|hold on|barricade|block|blockade] fighting to [clear|clearly|all the way|percipient|absolved] her [husband|conserve|economize|economise|hubby]'s [name|diagnose|list|identify|discover].","There's nobody guilty for this crime because there was no crime committed, she said. We [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] not [allow|permit|tolerate|give up|admit] him to [sit|seat|sit down|baby-sit|babysit] in that [jail|imprison|incarcerate|lag|immure|put behind bars] cell for one day longer than he has to.","...whatever it takes to make sure my [husband|conserve|economize|economise|hubby] is exonerated and the truth is known and that he comes [home|home|interior|internal|national]. That's what matters, she continued. ","With Curtis' [fate|destine|doom|designate|fortune] in limbo, Lyndsay Lovelace and her grandmother, Marty Didriksen, [continue|cover|extend|stay|stay on] to [try|try on|render|strain|stress] to [move|make a motion|go|run|motivate] [forward|fore|ahead|onward|onwards] while keeping the [focus|focalize|focalise|sharpen|concenter] on the cherished life they lost.","You [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t [want|need|require|desire|wish] to [lose|suffer|miss|turn a loss] [sight|spy|batch|deal|flock] of Cory. She died too young. She left children. There's a family here. I [mean|bastardly|beggarly|mingy|miserly], Lindsey and her brothers. So [try|try on|render|strain|stress] to [put|arrange|set up|order|place] that [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards] together if we can and [move|make a motion|go|run|motivate] [forward|fore|ahead|onward|onwards], she said.","","","I just [want|need|require|desire|wish] everyone to [find|find oneself|recover|retrieve|regain] happiness again. And be able to [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of] the good times rather than the bad times, said Lyndsay.","She was an amazing woman ... she loved with the biggest heart. She had a beautiful personality, Lyndsay said of her [mother|beget|get|engender|father|]. She touched so many [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] and that's who she needs to be remembered as.","Curtis  Lovelace's new trial [date|go steady|go out|see|date stamp] is scheduled for May 31.
