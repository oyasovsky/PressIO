But backlash against Beyonce started almost immediately after the superstar singer's release of her controversial \"Formation\" music video and Super Bowl 50 halftime show performance earlier this month.","Critics have objected to the #BlackLivesMatter themes in both, and specifically to her backup dancers at the halftime performance being outfitted in Black Panther-like costumes. ","In one portion of the music video, a young African-American boy wearing a hoodie dances before a line of police officers wearing riot gear before the words \"Stop Shooting Us\" appear in graffiti on a wall.","\"To taint police officers globally in the Super Bowl is really wrong,\" said Sgt. Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association in New York City.","CNN's Darius Johnson, Sheena Jones and Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report."],"secondary":["Mullins said the boycott, which he supports, would involve officers refusing to work paid off-duty security for the event, not refusing to perform regular law enforcement duties.","\"I can guarantee that if Beyonce needs help anywhere, police would respond,\" Mullins said, adding that he is concerned that even though \"she is in a major position to do things that are positive\" she is pitting herself against law enforcement.","\"She made a statement and now law enforcement is making a statement. What's clear is that no one in the country is trying to resolve the issues between communities of color and the distrust of law enforcement,\" he said. ","Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was also a vocal critic of the halftime show, telling CNN's Don Lemon that he found it emotionally offensive. Giuliani also said the singer should use her celebrity to encourage people \"to respect the uniform, not to make it appear as if they are the enemy.\"  ","Representatives for the Stop Mass Incarceration Network disagreed, arguing that celebrities like Beyonce have a right to speak out against police brutality without being attacked. ","A statement released by the group, founded in part by Dr. Cornel West in 2011, said, \"At a time when people have been rising up against the genocidal tide of police terror and mass incarceration in ways we haven't seen since the 60's, backward fascist reactionaries like Rudolph Giuliani and various national police organizations have unleashed a torrent of abuse attacking Beyonce and accusing her of 'cop killer entertainment.'\"","But Mullins said that when celebrities like Beyonce and public officials make statements against law enforcement, it makes officers' jobs more dangerous. He says they have seen more assaults on law enforcement due to anti-police sentiment.","The National Sheriffs' Association blamed Beyonce's \"anti-police 'entertainment'\" performance for four officer deaths last week. And after shots were fired outside his home this week, a sheriff in Tennessee held a news conference saying Beyonce's video may have provoked the shootings.","Later, in a Facebook post, Rutherford County, Tennessee, Sheriff Robert Arnold said his comments \"reflect the violence and senseless killing of seven deputies in the U.S. since the show aired. My comments are an observation of the violence that has occurred but in no way is meant to offend anyone.\"","The executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations pledged the group's support Friday for the boycott. ","\"Why would any group of working men and women support a rich celebrity who openly glorifies murderers?  Why would anybody?\" asked the group's executive director, Bill Johnson. ","The Massachusetts Police Association said it is just beginning to discuss the issue of the boycott, while other police unions are starting to hold meetings to decide how they will handle the situation. ","Frederick Frazier with the Dallas Police Association in Texas said the group is discussing the possibility of joining the boycott.","\"We are very happy that our brothers and sisters in blue are boycotting anyone who tarnishes the image of law enforcement,\" Frazier told CNN. \"And when she (Beyonce) comes to Dallas, she needs to know that the anti-police message is not welcomed. We respect anyone's First Amendment rights, but we also respect our officers and any law-abiding citizens (and) we will not respect those who tarnish our profession.\"","Joe Gamaldi, the vice president of the Houston Police Officers' Union in Texas, said the group wants more information before deciding whether to join the boycott. ","\"It is not needed until she explains her video and whether there is an anti- police address/message she is trying to bring to the public,\" Gamaldi said.","In a statement, Javier Ortiz, president of the Miami Fraternal Order of Police, accused the singer of using her recent Super Bowl performance \"to divide Americans by promoting the Black Panthers and her anti-police message.\"","Ortiz wrote Thursday that he \"was one of the tens of thousands of law enforcement officers that didn't watch the Super Bowl halftime show of respect for our profession,\" but that \"on another day while flipping through the television channels, I did mistakenly watch her 'Formation' video.\"","A representative for Beyonce was not immediately available to comment. But a spokesman for the Miami Police Department told The Huffington Post that the union spoke only for itself and that \"there's no indication that anything that is said there will translate into police officers not working the job.\"","\"The smartest thing for everybody to do is to find a table and sit down and to create an atmosphere and programs that benefit children and police officers, to rebuild trust and change a culture that is now in existence,\" Mullins said, offering to work with Beyonce to build such programs."]}}],[{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","articleData":{"title":"Trump cites bullets dipped in blood","content":"Donald Trump on Friday cited an apocryphal story about a U.S. general who purportedly dipped bullets in pigs' blood to execute Muslim prisoners a century ago in an effort to deter Islamic terrorism.<br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392162192/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392162192/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392162192/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392162192/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392162192/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392162192/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392162192/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392162192/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392162192/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/ach.htm\"><img src=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392162192/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/ach.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247392162192/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/247392162192/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/a2t2.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/>","published":"2016-02-20T19:47:49.000Z","author":"","link":"http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4dbb572d/sc/7/l/0Ledition0Bcnn0N0C20A160C0A20C190Cpolitics0Cdonald0Etrump0Esouth0Ecarolina0Ejohn0Epershing0Cindex0Bhtml0Deref0Fedition/story01.htm","feed":{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","link":"http://edition.cnn.com/index.html?eref=edition","name":"CNN.com - Top Stories"}},"parsedData":{"nouns":["trump","blood"],"verbs":[],"adjectives":["dipped"],"adverbs":[],"rest":["cites","bullets"]},"pharagraps":{"main":["North Charleston, South Carolina (CNN)Donald Trump on Friday cited an apocryphal story about a U.S. general who purportedly dipped bullets in pigs' blood to execute Muslim prisoners a century ago in an effort to deter Islamic terrorism."],"med":["Speaking at a rally in North Charleston, South Carolina, Trump reiterated his claim that the U.S. should \"go much further\" than waterboarding suspected terrorists, telling the story of Gen.

That's not what the United States is about,\" Rubio said.","Later Saturday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a leading Muslim civil rights group, said Trump's \"rhetoric has crossed the line from spreading hatred to inciting violence.\"","\"By directly stating that the only way to stop terrorism is to murder Muslims in graphic and religiously-offensive ways, he places the millions of innocent, law-abiding citizens in the American Muslim community at risk from rogue vigilantes,\" the group said in a statement. \"He further implies that our nation should adopt a strategy of systematized violence in its engagement with the global Muslim community, a chilling message from a potential leader.

Who knew this was going to happen? I figured maybe I'd be in the pack,\" a subdued Trump said as he began his final rally before South Carolina's Republican primary on Saturday, which could hand Trump his second consecutive electoral victory. \"I thought it was going to be like a horse race. I'd be in the middle of the pack and at the very end I'd inch it out.\"","But Trump isn't in the middle of the pack, ready to inch out a victory in South Carolina. He's leading it, with CNN's average of South Carolina polling showing Trump with a double-digit lead over his closest competitor, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. The victory would be a momentous one for Trump and a blow to several of his opponents, including Cruz, who has positioned himself as the conservative capable of rallying the South to capture the nomination.","At Friday's rally, Trump ripped Cruz as someone \"who lies more than any other human being I have ever seen\" and slammed politicians broadly as \"all taken care of by every industry.\"","And while Trump touted his 20-point victory just a week earlier in the New Hampshire primary, he also sought to undercut his supporters' -- and the media's expectations -- urging them not to look at the polling showing him poised to clutch a decisive victory, but instead to get out and vote like they were preparing for a nail-biter.","\"Who knows what the numbers are. The polls are very nice. Who knows? We can't take a chance,\" Trump said in comments starkly in contrast with his predictions of a \"tremendous victory\" in Iowa the day he ultimately faltered with a second-place finish.","\"It's crunch time, folks. It's crunch time,\" he reminded the audience.","But Trump ended the night on a reflective note, reminding his supporters that they are part of a movement of which he is simply the \"messenger\" -- and urging them to get out and vote.","\"You're going to say to yourselves this was one of the greatest evenings and one of the great days of your lives,\" Trump said.","\"We're going to make America great again.

Results from both will tell us much about the future of the race and the strength of the contenders.","Here are four things to watch on Saturday.","","Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders surpassed expectations in New Hampshire by delivering a wallop to Hillary Clinton after nearly tying her in Iowa. The caucuses in Nevada will help indicate whether the senator from Vermont has the organizational prowess, ground game and support necessary to deliver a true, long-term challenge to the former secretary of state. ",""],"secondary":["Clinton's campaign initially projected confidence in Nevada, pointing to her appeal to the state's Latino voting population, but after New Hampshire, her team softened the rhetoric about the western state. Still, a victory for Sanders -- or even a result similar to Iowa -- will provide a major boost of momentum for Sanders heading into Super Tuesday. Conversely, if Clinton wins by a solid margin, she can begin to firm up the conventional wisdom that she still is the inevitable nominee. ","By early afternoon in the Silver State, the two were locked in a tight race, with early entrance polls indicating Sanders was slightly ahead of Clinton, 49% to 47%.","Minority voters are turning out in strong numbers while a large number of attendees identified as liberal, according to the entrance poll results.","The early entrance polls reflect the views of the first few caucusgoers to arrive at each surveyed caucus site, and those arriving early aren't always similar to those who arrive at just before the doors close. These numbers may change as the final caucusgoers are incorporated after doors have closed.","","Businessman Donald Trump has held a consistent polling lead among South Carolina Republicans that is likely to carry him to first place there. If the polls hold up, that could make the race for runner-up the biggest surprise coming out of the primary. ","The Republican race for the nomination is increasingly looking like a three-man race between Trump, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. A second-place finish between the senators will help give them a leg up in the upcoming contests, although a third-place finish won't knock either of them out, either. ","Coming in behind Trump will allow the runner-up to present himself as the alternative to Trump. ","","Trump is going into South Carolina with strong numbers, but he took some risks by blaming former President George W. Bush for the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. ","\"The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush,\" Trump said Saturday during the CBS debate in Greenville. \"That's not keeping us safe. ... George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.\"","Trump's comments elicited a boisterous negative response from audience members in the hall and provided an opening for other candidates to criticize him. ","South Carolina is home to eight military bases and tens of thousands of veterans. Will Trump's outspoken assessment that their sacrifices in the wars of the past 15 years were part of a \"mistake\" hurt his appeal and soften his lead?","Also, will Trump's apparent support for the Iraq War in a September 2002 interview with Howard Stern -- which surfaced late Thursday and seemed to contradict his oft-repeated claim that he opposed the war since before it began -- hurt him with voters?","\"Yeah, I may have,\" Trump said in a CNN Republican presidential town hall hosted by Anderson Cooper when asked if he had signaled to Stern that he was in favor of invading Iraq. \"By the time the war started I was against it. And shortly thereafter, I was really against it.\"","He added that at the time he \"was not a politician.\"","","Bush has poured just about everything he's got in South Carolina. He's spent millions. He flew in his family, including his mother and his brother, George W. Bush, who has remained off the campaign trail until now. While he was able to secure the endorsement from South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, other key GOP figures in the state have looked elsewhere: South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. Trey Gowdy, all influential leaders in the state, have endorsed Rubio.  ","Bush and his allies have set high expectations in the state by calling it \"Bush country,\" so a poor showing would reinforce the notion that he has failed to inspire the Republican electorate, especially after failing to come close to achieving top-tier results in Iowa and New Hampshire, where he came in sixth and fourth, respectively. ","Coming in a distant fourth in South Carolina will send him limping into Nevada, where the most recent CNN/ORC survey puts him at just 1%.

At stake are 50 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination.","Donald Trump goes into the vote as the front-runner after a frenzied final week of campaigning that saw the billionaire real-estate mogul wage a rhetorical war with Pope Francis and several candidates bluntly accuse their rivals of peddling outright lies.","Live updates: Nevada Democratic caucuses and South Carolina Republican primary","There was a furor over doctored pictures of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in a Photoshopped handshake with President Barack Obama and a shouting match -- again initiated by Trump's willingness to slay sacred cows -- over who was to blame for 9/11.",""],"secondary":["And Trump again managed to draw controversy in his final rally before the primary Friday night, when he told an apocryphal story of Gen. John Pershing, who purportedly dipped bullets in pigs' blood to execute Muslim prisoners a century ago in an effort to deter Islamic terrorism. Rubio, speaking to NBC's \"Today\" show on Saturday, called the tale \"bizarre\" and said \"that's not what the United States is all about.\"","Former President George W. Bush himself was back on the trail for the first time since leaving the White House, showing that his campaign skills are as polished as ever. But the 43rd president may not have done enough to rescue his brother Jeb, who is struggling to gain traction.","The latest CNN Poll of Polls on Friday showed Trump potentially on the verge of another huge victory to back up his thumping win in New Hampshire last week.","The businessman led with 34% support, ahead of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 20% and Rubio at 15%. Bush was fourth with 11%, ahead of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 8%.","Related: 5 takeaways from the CNN Republican town hall","One point back was Ohio Gov. John Kasich. He might get a pass in South Carolina, however, because his more-moderate conservative profile is a weaker fit in the Palmetto State than in New Hampshire, where he came in second last week.","A Trump victory in South Carolina on Saturday would send new shockwaves through the Republican establishment and possibly augur another strong showing for the front-runner in Southern states with a similar ideological profile on Super Tuesday, March 1.","Despite an aberration in 2012, when the state's Republican voters went for Newt Gingrich, the South Carolina primary has historically been a barometer of party opinion, going for the eventual nominee in every other presidential primary since 1980.","It's also a good approximation of the party as a whole. It has a mixture of conservative and evangelical voters, particularly in the northwest of the state, and an influential bloc of retired military veterans who hanker for a tough message on national security, with more moderate Republicans on the Atlantic coast where cities have swelled with migrants from northern states.","The race is another test of whether the outspoken former reality star can defy political logic after firing off a string of political assaults, notably accusing George W. Bush of not doing enough to thwart the September 11 attacks and of lying America into the Iraq war. Bush remains popular in South Carolina, so while Trump's attacks could endear him to his anti-establishment base, they also could backfire.","But Trump appears confident that his lead will hold up on Saturday, having proven that his campaign, despite doubts about his ground game, was able to turn poll numbers into significant amounts of votes in New Hampshire.","Trump -- who has taken aim at establishment figures throughout his campaign -- also found himself at odds with the head of the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday, when Pope Francis warned that his talk of building walls to keep out immigrants was hardly Christian.","The spat may have helped Trump, given the lack of Roman Catholics in South Carolina -- 7% according to the beliefnet website. Some evangelicals, meanwhile, mistrust Francis' comparatively progressive views on certain social and economic questions. And the exchange allowed the billionaire to once again dominate the media as he restated a hardline position on illegal immigration popular among many conservatives.","Behind Trump, a furious battle appears to be raging for second place between a pair of Cuban-American senators, Rubio and Cruz, who have engaged in a series of angry exchanges that reflect the intensity of the South Carolina race.","Rubio is looking for a strong performance on Saturday to validate the comeback story he has been building after slumping to fifth place in New Hampshire. Just days earlier he was pummeled in a debate by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has since dropped out of the race.","Rubio secured the endorsement of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, both rising stars in the GOP, and has hired a group of political consultants who learned their trade in the Palmetto State so must deal with rising expectations for a competitive showing on Saturday.","A good result for Cruz, meanwhile, would lend credence to a theory of the campaign that rests on a string of strong performances in very conservative and evangelical Southern states.","In their latest spat, Rubio expressed outrage at a doctored photo distributed by Cruz's campaign purportedly showing him shaking hands with Obama. ","But Cruz hit back by saying Rubio was just like Trump and had a thin skin when it was his turn to absorb an attack. \"They start screaming, 'liar, liar, liar,'\" Cruz said.","Former Florida Gov. Bush, meanwhile, is trying to use South Carolina -- a stronghold for the presidential campaigns of his brother and father -- to launch a comeback after bad showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.","But he has struggled for traction and if he fails to beat Rubio on Saturday, he will face questions about the rationale for continuing a campaign that is currently helping to fracture the establishment wing of the party and leaving an opening for Trump to build momentum."]}}],[{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","articleData":{"title":"Clinton hoping Hispanics in Nevada give her edge over Sanders","content":"<br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392162190/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392162190/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392162190/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392162190/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392162190/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392162190/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392162190/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392162190/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392162190/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/ach.htm\"><img src=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392162190/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/ach.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247392162190/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/247392162190/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/a2t2.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/>","published":"2016-02-20T19:47:48.000Z","author":"","link":"http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4dbb572a/sc/7/l/0Ledition0Bcnn0N0C20A160C0A20C20A0Cpolitics0Cnevada0Ecaucus0Edemocrats0E20A160Cindex0Bhtml0Deref0Fedition/story01.htm","feed":{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","link":"http://edition.cnn.com/index.html?eref=edition","name":"CNN.com - Top Stories"}},"parsedData":{"nouns":["nevada","give","edge","clinton"],"verbs":[],"adjectives":[],"adverbs":[],"rest":["sanders","hoping","hispanics"]},"pharagraps":{"main":["Las Vegas (CNN)Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are locked in a tight race in Nevada as Democrats caucus in a state once viewed as a firewall for the former secretary of state."],"med":["Early entrance polls indicate Sanders is slightly ahead of Clinton 49% to 47%.","Minority voters are turning out in strong numbers while a large number of attendees identified as liberal, according to the entrance poll results.","The early entrance polls reflect the views of the first few caucusgoers to arrive at each surveyed caucus site, and those arriving early aren't always similar to those who arrive at just before the doors close.

At the same time, they pushed for Clinton in Nevada's rural counties -- where Clinton's canvassers have been pressing the case that Sanders' proposals are unrealistic and unachievable in the current political climate.","Clinton has sought a strong win here to provide a jolt of momentum heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday.

Both campaigns had heavily courted the powerful Culinary Workers Union, which supported Obama in 2008 and helped him turn out voters to caucus. But in a blow to Clinton's campaign, they chose to stay neutral this year.","Like Obama in 2008, Sanders is counting on a strong turnout from first-time caucusgoers, though not nearly as many are expected as eight years ago when some 120,000 turned out.","Though Clinton is perceived as having an advantage with voters in Clark County, in part because of her strong support from labor unions, Sanders spent a good amount of time campaigning around the populous areas of Las Vegas this week before heading to Elko, Nevada, on Friday to rally rural voters.","During both an MSNBC forum and a speech at the Clark County Democratic Dinner on Thursday night, Sanders made a direct pitch to Latinos by chiding Donald Trump for vilifying immigrants. He argued that Congress \"must move towards a path for citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\"","\"While I understand that there are people who have differences of opinion with me on immigration reform, there is no justification, no reason, to resort to bigotry and xenophobia when we are talking about Mexicans or we are talking about Muslims,\" Sanders said at the Democratic dinner at the Tropicana Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.","\"People can disagree about immigration reform, but in the year 2016, we will not allow the Trumps and others to divide us up and appeal to racism, which has done this country so much harm for so many years,\" he said.","During the MSNBC/Telemundo forum, Sanders also defended his 2007 vote against legislation that would have revamped the immigration system, stating that he objected to guest-worker provisions that were described by one legal advocacy group as being \"akin to slavery.\"  ","Both Sanders and Clinton have also made an aggressive play for Nevada's rural voters this cycle. Clinton won the popular vote here in 2008. But by organizing in the delegate-rich rural counties of Nevada, Obama won more nominating delegates to the Democratic National Convention than Clinton.","Clinton is heavily organized in those rural counties this time. The looming question is whether her campaign will be able to overcome the enthusiasm for Sanders, as well as a palpable level of discomfort with her position on gun control compared to Sanders' more moderate stances. ","At a town hall in Elko Friday morning, Sanders stressed the importance of turnout among rural voters to his campaign, calling on them to show the world the desire for a \"political revolution that transforms this country.\"","\"I really believe this from my heart of hearts: obviously we are here to win and hope to win. I want democracy to flourish,\" Sanders said. \"I hope Nevada turns out -- I hope we have a YUGE turnout -- I'm afraid to use that word! But I hope we have a very, very large voter turnout.

"],"med":["500 years after his death, he is finally being accorded an honor almost certainly unthinkable during his lifetime -- a retrospective in his home city of s-Hertogenbosch (better known as ' Den Bosch' -- or the Forest) in the south of the Netherlands. A mere 16 years into the new century, one British art critic has already hailed the exhibition one of the most important of our time.","Like a later Dutch master, Vermeer, Bosch didn't leave us much -- just 25 paintings and 25 drawings. But the small municipal Noordbrabants Museum has managed to borrow most of them (20 paintings, 19 drawings -- everything pretty much except \"The Garden of Earthly Delights,\" his best known surviving work), even though it had nothing to lend in return. ","","The museum's director Charles de Mooij was astounded by the generosity of his museum colleagues, their desire to share and increase the public's knowledge of Bosch. ",""],"secondary":["Paintings have come from the Louvre in Paris, the Prado in Madrid, the Accademia in Venice, the Metropolitan in New York and the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Many have been freshly conserved, altar triptychs thrillingly reunited. These are works that originally hung in churches, monasteries and royal and ducal palaces.","Bosch gave us the stuff of nightmares, things and people impaled, all manner of beasts. A King's Librarian (to Phillip II of Spain who collected Bosch after his death) described the work as \"a satire in paint on the sins of men\" and so it clearly is. ","","In this case, the devil is literally in the detail. The manically inventive imagery, the bestiary has evidently continued to feed the modern imagination. ","Critics habitually draw parallels with Dali and Magritte and Francis Bacon. George Lucas was apparently inspired by Bosch when he dreamt up some of his aliens for \"Star Wars.\" ","The American thriller writer, Michael Connelly has long regarded Los Angeles as being a contemporary \"Garden of Earthly Delights\"; he named his L.A. police detective Harry \"Hieronymus\" Bosch.  ","Charles de Mooij wouldn't be drawn on the subconscious affect of the imagery. \"I'm not a psychologist,\" he said with a laugh. He suggested perhaps that from the 20th century onwards, we began to impose our ideas on Bosch rather than the other way around.","Mooij sees Bosch as an absolutely singular artist, hugely admired by his contemporaries and patronized by Church and nobility. He was a committed Catholic -- a member of an influential Christian brotherhood in his hometown with its 30 churches. We know that he came from a large family of painters: his father, his grandfather, his uncles, his nephews -- almost all of them painted. But Bosch's gifts set him apart.","","He was a story-teller, depicting Everyman as pilgrim on his journey to death. The works were intended as conversation pieces, making the viewer ponder on their own weaknesses and sins. Fundamentally, Bosch was putting the fear of God into his fellow man. ","Be warned -- take care of your eternal soul.","Mooij estimates some of the major works may have taken as long as a year to paint. And Bosch worked at a certain disadvantage. Time was relatively short. Like all good Christians, he wouldn't have painted on Feast Days -- and they accounted for almost a third of calendar.","After close infrared study, particularly of the drawings, Mooj marvels at how vividly and quickly Bosch worked. \"You can see he was always changing, constantly changing.\" There is something quiksilver about him. He changes his mind, has another idea with the paint still wet.  Finally, in the anniversary year of his death, Hieronymus Bosch is getting the same level of scholarly study long afforded his immediate Italian contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci.","The exhibition at the Noordbrabants Museum -- \"Hieronymus Bosch: Visions of Genius\"  -- runs thru May 8th before moving to the Prado in Madrid where it will join Bosch's work '\"The Garden of Earthly Delights.\""]}}],[{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","articleData":{"title":"Saturday Night Live!

It is a replacement for the one that crashed in 2014, killing a test pilot.","Physicist Stephen Hawking named the new vehicle Virgin Spaceship (VSS) Unity in a recorded speech and on Twitter. ","\"I would be very proud to fly on this spaceship,\" Hawking  said.","Branson said the new vehicle means space can be made accessible in a way that has only been dreamed about before. ",""],"secondary":[" \"Our beautiful new spaceship, VSS Unity, is the embodiment of that goal and also a great testament to what can be achieved when true teamwork, great skill and deep pride are combined with a common purpose,\" Branson said, according to a company press release.","On Thursday, the company said that because of the fatal crash, the new spaceship will not \"blast off and head straight to space\" anytime soon. Instead, it faces an extensive testing period.","Once the craft has fully checked out, Virgin Galactic plans to use it to ferry passengers up 50 miles above Earth's surface -- a height the company said will qualify them as \"bona fide space tourists.\""," \"One of the things that I think is most powerful is that we'll be able to get a new perspective on our planet as hundreds and eventually millions of people are able to go into space,\" said George Whitesides, the company's CEO. "," More than 700 people have signed up to fly on Virgin Galactic -- even though the company requires $250,000 up front for a seat. ","So when will passenger flights begin? The company's tweets and press release are noticeably short on dates. But here are some of the key things that Virgin Galactic said will happen next:","•         After the ground tests are done, the spaceship will be flown on the back of its mothership, WhiteKnightTwo.","•         Next comes glide testing: The craft flies like a glider from an altitude of 45,000+ feet (8 miles) while pilots test its handling.","•         Rocket-powered test flights are next, each flight going a little higher and a little faster. When it crosses 100,000 feet (19 miles), the spaceship will be above 99% of the atmosphere and the pilots will experience weightlessness.","•         When it reaches 50 miles (80 kilometers), the pilots will have met NASA and the U.S. Air Force's requirements for official astronaut status, and they will be recognized by the Virgin Galactic team and by the U.S. government as bonafide space travelers.","The company said it has made many updates to the craft -- the most important being the feather inhibitor. The plane's feathers are a critical component of its reentry system. The accident that occurred in 2014 was a result of the feathers being prematurely being unlocked. ","\"The actual accident itself was caused by a control being moved when it shouldn't have,\" said Dave Mackay, the chief pilot for Galactic. \"We've implemented a new system, which prevents that from ever happening again.  So it's physically impossible to move that control at the point that it was moved during the accident.\"","While some of their competitors' ships, such as New Shepard from Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, don't have pilots and instead rely on automation, Virgin Galactic's system is entirely dependent on the skill of its pilots.","\"The pilots are controlling what the vehicle does at any stage,\" Mackay said. \"It's all dependent on the pilot.\"","Mackay said this strategy was pursed by the company for simplicity: \"The responsibility is high. But the reason that we've done it in the first place is to keep everything as simple as possible. The rationale is if you have a simple system, it's less likely to fail, and is therefore inherently safer.\"","Becoming a member of Virgin's elite pilot corps is no easy feat.  Virgin has five pilots, whose resumes all have the \"right stuff\" -- military, commercial, and test flying experience. Mackay himself has flown over 140 different types of aircraft.","When asked what it takes to be a Virgin Galactic pilot, Mackay said, \"We look for the most experienced test pilots that we can get. Test flying is important, because we're in the test and development phase of the vehicle.  And we're doing something which is unique.  It's very, very unusual.\"","Virgin's pilots also undergo intense training, using a sophisticated simulator until the spaceship is operational.","And while it will never be quite the same as actually being in space, Mackay said the time in the simulator is extremely valuable: \"This is as close as you can get to actually recreating it. You can't simulate the high G forces that we will feel during the rocket motor burn.  And of course you can't simulate the extended zero G experience.  You couldn't do that in any simulation sort of device.  But this is a hugely valuable tool for practicing flying the vehicle, how you operate it, how you operate it efficiently, and how the systems work, and what to do if a particular system or component might fail.\""," And not only is the simulator work valuable for pilot training, but it also helps with the actual spaceship design process:  \"A lot of the the work that we've done improving the vehicle, and developing the vehicle is done in the simulator first of all.  And then if we like what we've seen in the simulator we incorporate it in the actual vehicle itself.\""," Even when Virgin Galactic finally takes up its first passengers, it won't be the first time civilians have gone to space. The world's first paying space tourist was American businessman and former NASA engineer Dennis Tito. "," Tito flew to the International Space Station in 2001. His ride up? A Russian Soyuz rocket. He paid $20 million for the trip."," Six other people also flew as tourists to the space station."," Now that the new spaceship is closer to flying, the dream of civilian space travel for the non-millionaire crowd is closer to reality."," \"It's a significant moment I think in aviation history,\" said Mackay. \"This is the vehicle that is going to take many hundreds of regular people into space for the first time.\" "]}}],[{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","articleData":{"title":"Prisoner freed after 43 years in solitary confinement","content":"<br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392133916/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db9e130/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392133916/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db9e130/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392133916/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db9e130/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392133916/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db9e130/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392133916/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db9e130/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392133916/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db9e130/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392133916/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db9e130/sc/13/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392133916/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db9e130/sc/13/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392133916/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db9e130/sc/13/ach.htm\"><img src=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392133916/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db9e130/sc/13/ach.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247392133916/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db9e130/sc/13/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/247392133916/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db9e130/sc/13/a2t2.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4db9e130/sc/13/mf.gif' border='0'/>","published":"2016-02-20T17:09:12.000Z","author":"","link":"http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4db9e130/sc/13/l/0Ledition0Bcnn0N0C20A160C0A20C190Cus0Cangola0E30Ealbert0Ewoodfox0Ereleased0Cindex0Bhtml0Deref0Fedition/story01.htm","feed":{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","link":"http://edition.cnn.com/index.html?eref=edition","name":"CNN.com - Top Stories"}},"parsedData":{"nouns":["years","solitary","prisoner","confinement"],"verbs":[],"adjectives":["43"],"adverbs":[],"rest":["freed"]},"pharagraps":{"main":[" (CNN)Albert Woodfox, the last incarcerated member of the so-called \"Angola 3,\" was released from a prison in Louisiana on Friday, his attorneys announced.

It was not immediately clear whether Chouchane was killed, Earnest said Friday.","Chouchane is thought to have played an instrumental role in two terrorist attacks in Tunisia last year, one at Tunis' Bardo Museum that killed 23 people and another at a seaside resort in Sousse that left 38 people dead. ISIS claimed responsibility for both massacres.","Conflicting information emerged about whether the strike also might have killed two Serbian Embassy employees who were kidnapped last year.","Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic said the pair -- communications officer Sladjana Stankovic and driver Jovica Stepic, who were kidnapped in Sabratah in November 2015 -- were believed to be among the dead.","CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq, Hamdi Alkhshali, Tim Lister, Paul Cruickshank, Kevin Bohn and Michael Martinez contributed to this report."],"secondary":["The Pentagon knows of the reports claiming deaths of \"two Serbian hostages,\" but \"at this time, we have no information indicating that their deaths were a result of the strike,\" spokesman Peter Cook said.","\"Our forces watched this training camp for weeks leading up to the operation, and at the time of the strike there were no indications of any civilians present. While the circumstances of their deaths remain unclear, we, nevertheless, express our deepest condolences to the Serbian government and the families of those killed,\" Cook said.","\"When conducting our operations, the U.S. military goes to extraordinary lengths to limit the risk of civilian casualties, and in our campaign to defeat ISIL we will continue to do so,\" Cook said.","A spokeswoman for the Serbian Foreign Ministry emphasized that Serbia still was waiting for official confirmation from Libyan authorities about whether the Serbian pair were among the dead.  She said that Serbia had been informed by the Pentagon that the specific location where they were believed to be held had been bombed.","Friday morning's U.S. strike in the al-Qasser district in Sabratha, a coastal city in northwestern Libya where most residents are from Tunisia, killed at least 49 people, Hussain al-Thawadi, the Mayor of Sabratah, said.","Al-Thawadi told Libya TV in an interview the death toll could rise because more people might still be under the rubble. He said the house was rented by suspected ISIS members, and he believed more than 60 people were inside it when it was hit.","Also six people were wounded, according to the Sabratha Municipal Council. ","A Libyan man started to expand the house in Sabratha to several levels last year, security officials in the city said. He had brought in several groups of fighters over the past few months, including one batch two days ago. That house was struck Friday.","Over the last several weeks, the United States observed militants moving around the site and undergoing what appeared to be special training, a U.S. official said.  \"This was outside the normal training camp scenario,\" the official said.","The activity raised concerns the people there might be planning to launch an external attack, though no details were discovered about where or when this might take place.","The U.S. military has launched hundreds of airstrikes against ISIS targets over the past two years. These have been concentrated in Iraq and Syria, where the Islamist extremist group has established its biggest foothold and has its de facto capital in Raqqa.","But Libya -- a North African nation that's been in turmoil and a hotbed for some militant groups since a 2011 revolution that toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi -- has been in its crosshairs as well.","","ISIS has emerged as the world's top terrorist threat, having conducted or inspired about 70 attacks in 20 countries since declaring its caliphate in June 2014. ","Mapping ISIS attacks worldwide","It is significant that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi exerts more control over the ISIS branch in Libya than any other, according to a report late last year to the United Nations Security Council. This conclusion is in line with U.S. intelligence determinations that al-Baghdadi sees the relatively lawless, impoverished North African state as prime ground to enlarge his self-declared caliphate.","The group has asserted itself in Libya by taking over territory and exercising terror, as evidenced by its beheadings of Egyptian Coptic Christians about a year ago on a Libyan beach.","Libya has also been a base to train militants, devise plots and launch them in places like neighboring Tunisia, which has been considered the Arab Spring's success story but has not been immune to the violence wrenching the region.","The Bardo Museum and Sousse beach attacks are gut-wrenching proof of that, not just because of the human carnage but also for their negative effects on a Tunisian economy that's long benefited from tourism.","Both attacks were carried out by one terror cell whose members came from Tunisia, communicated with ISIS leaders in Syria and Iraq, and trained in Libya, a Western counterterrorism source said. That training happened near Sabratha, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east of the Tunisian border where the Friday morning strike took place. ","The same cell planned to attack France's diplomatic complex in Tunis, only to be thwarted as Tunisian security forces moved in, according to the source. ","All of its roughly half dozen core members -- at least those not killed in attacks -- who were still in Tunisia are now in custody. But others involved in the plots may not be in the country, possibly finding refuge in their former training ground in Libya instead.","","It's no surprise the United States would help Tunisia. Last May, President Barack Obama cemented America's strong ties by designating the country as \"a major non-NATO ally.\"","A few weeks ago, Obama's top military adviser talked about stepping up efforts to curtail ISIS specifically in the North African country.","Addressing reporters while traveling in Europe, Gen. Joseph Dunford, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, said the United States wants to \"take decisive military action\" to \"check\" ISIS in Libya."]}}],[{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","articleData":{"title":"Mourners pay tribute at Scalia's funeral","content":"Thousands of mourners paid their respects Saturday to late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last week at age 79.<br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392151626/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbab531/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392151626/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbab531/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392151626/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbab531/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392151626/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbab531/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392151626/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbab531/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392151626/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbab531/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392151626/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbab531/sc/7/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392151626/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbab531/sc/7/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392151626/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbab531/sc/7/ach.htm\"><img src=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392151626/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbab531/sc/7/ach.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247392151626/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbab531/sc/7/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/247392151626/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4dbab531/sc/7/a2t2.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4dbab531/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/>","published":"2016-02-20T16:39:04.000Z","author":"","link":"http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4dbab531/sc/7/l/0Ledition0Bcnn0N0C20A160C0A20C20A0Cpolitics0Cantonin0Escalia0Efuneral0Cindex0Bhtml0Deref0Fedition/story01.htm","feed":{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","link":"http://edition.cnn.com/index.html?eref=edition","name":"CNN.com - Top Stories"}},"parsedData":{"nouns":["tribute","pay","funeral"],"verbs":[],"adjectives":[],"adverbs":[],"rest":["scalia","mourners"]},"pharagraps":{"main":["Washington  (CNN)A somber reunion of legal luminaries came to Washington on Saturday to celebrate the life of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last week at age 79."],"med":["Scalia's casket arrived at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington shortly after 11 a.m. ET.

His country will have special status in the EU. If it stay in the EU at all.","Britain, it is now understood by all, will never commit to \"ever closer union,\" which has been the central goal of the EU and its predecessor organizations for decades. And it will not have to give child-tax credits or other financial aid to European Union citizens in financial distress for the first seven years, even when they come from other EU countries. ","So Cameron has won his country special status within the European Union. Now he has called a referendum for Thursday, June 23, to give voters the chance the Labor Party long denied them -- to go the the voting booth and, should that be their desire, tell the EU to shove it.","CNN's Anna Stewart in Brussels, Lindsay Isaac, Pierre Meilhan and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report."],"secondary":["The choice facing UK voters will be whether to have outsized global influence in situations such as those in Ukraine or Iran, by participating in a huge international organization, or whether or to go it alone, and retain a greater degree of sovereignty than participation an organization like the EU allows.","Cameron made it clear Saturday that he wanted Britain to remain in the European Union.","","\"Leaving Europe would threaten our economic and national security,\" he said. He pledged to campaign to persuade British voters to approve continued participation in the wake of his negotiations.","And George Osborne, the country's chancellor of the Exchequer, or chief financial official, said that leaving the EU -- something he and the Prime Minister had recently been threatening to do, as they negotiated with other EU leaders -- would be \"a huge leap in the dark\" that carried grave risks.","But the deal and the referendum has split their Conservative Party, and some of Cameron's own appointees will campaign against him.","The most prominent Conservative opponent he will face over the coming weeks is Justice Secretary Michael Gove.","Gove said Saturday that Britain would be \"freer, fairer and better off outside the EU,\" the BBC reported","He said his decision to defy the Prime Minister was the most difficult of his career.","But he said, as quoted on the BBC, that the EU had \"proved a failure on so many fronts,\" and he felt compelled to put his political convictions before loyalty to Cameron..","","At least four other members of the Cabinet are deserting the Prime Minister on the issue.","Cameron had promised in 2013 that he would renegotiate the terms of the UK's participation in the EU, then return to the British people to allow them the final say as to whether the UK should stay in the EU or withdraw from it.","The agreement in Brussels late Friday came only after two days of tense talks with other EU leaders. Cameron said the EU provided the concessions he sought, including assurances that the other nations won't try to make Britain part of a \"European superstate.\"","\"There will be tough new restrictions on access to our welfare system for EU migrants,\" he said. \"No more something for nothing. Britain will never join the euro, and we've secured vital protections for our economy and a full say over the rules of the free-trade single-market while remaining outside the euro.\"","","World leaders praised the deal, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying the EU leaders clearly wanted Britain to stay.","\"We believe we have now given a package to David Cameron to elicit support in Britain for Britain remaining a member of the European Union,\" she said. \"This was his goal after all. There was no doubt about it.\"","At the heart of the talks among the 28 EU heads of government were Britain's demands to play by special rules within the union. The demands left some EU leaders cold, but there was no great appetite to see a British exit from the EU -- or \"Brexit,\" as it has come to be known.","A British departure would leave the EU diminished. It would lose its second-largest economy -- behind only that of Germany -- and one of its two members with permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council. (France holds the other.)","Cameron was upbeat at his news conference, saying, \"our plan for Europe gives us the best of both worlds.\"","Britain will maintain full access to the EU's free-trade market and benefit from Europe-wide cooperation on crime and terrorism, he said. ","But it will not have to cooperate in \"the parts of Europe that don't work for us,\" such as the euro currency and eurozone bailouts, Cameron said.","","The EU sprang from the ashes of World War II as a free-trade zone. Its signal achievement has been to allow free movement of goods and people in the hope that economic integration would prevent a new continental war.","Britain opted out of both those EU provisions, and it views with skepticism the EU's effort to branch into new fields, regulating everything from pesticides to human rights, and creating a unified foreign policy, too.","Merkel said Britain's demand not to pay benefits to migrants from other EU countries had been a sticking point.","Cameron also wanted to opt out of the standard EU commitment that its members must work toward \"ever closer union\" -- a goal that has animated the European project for decades.","He wants Britain exempted from having to give various social benefits to newcomers -- even from other EU countries -- until they have lived in the UK for several years.","","Britain has resisted the envisaged \"ever closer\" ties with the EU. It is not a member of the Schengen Agreement, which allows passport-free travel among most European countries. And when many EU countries scrapped their national currencies in favor of the euro, Britain said it would stick with the pound. ","The country's difficult relationship with the EU is nothing new. In the 1960s, French President Charles de Gaulle not only opposed Britain's entry into what was then called the Common Market, he also opposed any negotiations on the topic.","Britain didn't join the European Community, as it was then called, until 1973, by which time de Gaulle was dead.","There's no assurance the British people will approve the referendum.","The historic number of people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and North Africa -- most of them bound for Europe -- increases the chances that Britons, fearful about their jobs and their national identity, will try to pull up the drawbridge and go it alone.","For his part, U.S. President Barack Obama had urged Britain to stay in the EU. The UK as a member of the EU \"gives us much greater confidence about the strength of the trans-Atlantic union,\" Obama said in July. ","Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said the agreement doesn't compromise \"our fundamental values.\"","\"I deeply believe that the United Kingdom needs Europe and Europe needs the United Kingdom,\" Tusk said. \"To break the link now would be totally against our mutual interest. We have done all we could not to let that happen. But the final decision is in the hands of the British people.\"","Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel tweeted: \"We overcame our differences to reach a good #agreement. Now up to British people to decide. Good luck @David_Cameron.\"","Cameron said economics wasn't the only reason to stay in the EU. Security was another issue, especially in the age of terrorism, Cameron said.","\"This, in my view, is a time to stick together, a time for strength in numbers,\" he said."]}}],[{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","articleData":{"title":"How ISIS recruits, then kills, children","content":"<br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392068993/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db282fb/sc/33/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392068993/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db282fb/sc/33/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392068993/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db282fb/sc/33/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392068993/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db282fb/sc/33/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392068993/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db282fb/sc/33/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392068993/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db282fb/sc/33/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392068993/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db282fb/sc/33/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392068993/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db282fb/sc/33/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392068993/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db282fb/sc/33/ach.htm\"><img src=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392068993/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db282fb/sc/33/ach.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247392068993/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db282fb/sc/33/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/247392068993/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db282fb/sc/33/a2t2.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4db282fb/sc/33/mf.gif' border='0'/>","published":"2016-02-20T14:21:36.000Z","author":"","link":"http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4db282fb/sc/33/l/0Ledition0Bcnn0N0C20A160C0A20C190Cmiddleeast0Cisis0Echild0Esoldiers0Cindex0Bhtml0Deref0Fedition/story01.htm","feed":{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","link":"http://edition.cnn.com/index.html?eref=edition","name":"CNN.com - Top Stories"}},"parsedData":{"nouns":["isis"],"verbs":[],"adjectives":[],"adverbs":[],"rest":["recruits","kills","how","children"]},"pharagraps":{"main":[" (CNN)Eleven-year-old Abu Imara al Omri kneels down to kiss his father's hand; a final blessing before the boy blows himself up in a truck full of explosives."],"med":["The disturbing goodbye was captured in a series of ISIS propaganda photos last month.","Supporters of the terror group claim the boy was used to help take the village of Ghazl near Aleppo, Syria.","But Omri is not alone.

There's the question of what to do about potentially thousands of indoctrinated children left behind.","Opinion: How to beat ISIS propaganda ","The cases of Omri and the 88 other children eulogized by ISIS in the past 13 months are documented in the study, which includes an open source database of ISIS child propaganda, the first of its kind.","\"What this database points to is the fact that use of children is far more normalized,\" Charlie Winter, the report's co-author, told CNN. \"They are not just being used to shock people in execution videos. They are being used for their operational value as well. This is something that sadly we have to expect to increase and accelerate as the situation becomes more precarious for ISIS in the years to come.\"","Researchers from Georgia State University have been combing Twitter and ISIS channels on Telegram to record the children's ages, dates, nationalities -- anyone 18 or younger. The trends are striking and deeply troubling.","Child soldier who escaped ISIS: 'Like coming back to life'","","Most of the children are from Syria. Most were killed in Iraq. Of the 89 cases, 39% died detonating a vehicle born IED device and 33% were killed as foot soldiers. Some 4% killed themselves while committing mass casualty attacks against civilians, and 6% died as propagandists embedded with brigades.","Researchers say they've noticed an emerging ISIS tactic. ","Nearly 20% of the children killed were inghimasis, or \"marauders\" who carried out so-called \"plunging attacks.\" That's a military operation in which a group of fighters attack an enemy position before blowing themselves up.","Last month, five adult ISIS fighters flanked by three children infiltrated the Tariq base in Iraq. ISIS boasted that the group attacked from within for three hours, killing people before detonating their suicide belts. Winter says this shows the children are not being used to replace adults. They are integrated into ISIS' military operations -- often with parental consent.","\"It's interesting the degree to which the parents are giving the organization access to their children,\" said Mia Bloom, the co-author of the report. \"It's not a coercive endeavor like what we saw in Africa. The kids are not being kidnapped. The kids are not being coerced. For the most part, what we're seeing is kids posing with a big smile and at least in one case saying goodbye to the parents.\" ","Mass graves, missing children","","ISIS has long made clear its intent to raise the next generation of jihadists, calling them the \"cubs of the caliphate.\" In a recent publication of their English language magazine Dabiq, it encourages mothers to sacrifice their sons for the self-proclaimed Islamic state.","\"As for you, O mother of lion cubs. ... And what will make you know what the mother of lion cubs is? She is the teacher of generations and the producer of men,\" the article reads. ","Winters says what is happening is very similar to how Saddam Hussein used child fighters in Iraq.","\"Even right down to the cubs of the caliphate, there was the cubs of Saddam,\" he said. ","\"ISIS is integrating children into its project in a way that is more reminiscent of a state than a non-state actor. It's thinking with the long term in mind. It's not just bringing children into its ranks and using them immediately on the battlefield. What it's doing is bringing them in, indoctrinating them, training them, spending a lot of time instilling them with jihadist ideology.\"","Bloom says the database of 89 children killed is a snapshot of a larger phenomenon. She estimates there are at least 1,500 ISIS child fighters, which poses unique challenges for the coalition on the battlefield and in terms of rehabilitation.","\"The way you got the kids out of child soldiering in Liberia, Uganda or Mozambique was you use two things. You use the family and you use religion,\" Bloom says. ","\"The problem with ISIS is that they've distorted the religion, and the families are colluding with ISIS to allow them access to the kids. So there's additional challenges, and we don't have a really good template to use ... it's a big problem.\""]}}],[{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","articleData":{"title":"Where presidential statues go to die","content":"<br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392043381/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392043381/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392043381/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392043381/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392043381/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247392043381/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392043381/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247392043381/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392043381/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/ach.htm\"><img src=\"http://adchoice.feedsportal.com/r/247392043381/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/ach.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247392043381/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi2.feedsportal.com/r/247392043381/u/0/f/676993/c/35494/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/a2t2.img\" border=\"0\"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/>","published":"2016-02-20T14:13:37.000Z","author":"","link":"http://rss.cnn.com/c/35494/f/676993/s/4db4df4b/sc/7/l/0Ledition0Bcnn0N0C20A160C0A20C190Carts0Cu0Es0Epresident0Egraveyard0Esculptures0Cindex0Bhtml0Deref0Fedition/story01.htm","feed":{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","link":"http://edition.cnn.com/index.html?eref=edition","name":"CNN.com - Top Stories"}},"parsedData":{"nouns":["go","die"],"verbs":[],"adjectives":["presidential"],"adverbs":[],"rest":["where","statues"]},"pharagraps":{"main":[" (CNN)In a field in Williamsburg, Virginia, a ghostly army of U.S. presidents appears buried chest-deep, as if caught in a nightmarish quicksand."],"med":["George Washington's nose -- or what's left of it -- struggles to stay attached to his crumbling concrete face.
