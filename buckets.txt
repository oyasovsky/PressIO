","Since 2012, Kariko has been creating amazing portraits of tiny monsters many Americans [live|alive|hot|bouncy|lively] with every day, including boll weevils, [carpet|rug|carpeting] beetles, moths, [wheel|bicycle|cycle|bike|pedal|] bugs, ants and earwigs. ","Daniel Kariko is a photographer based in Greenville, North Carolina. His [work|sour|turn|ferment|solve] is also represented on LensCulture. "],"secondary":["His equipment isn't what you'd [expect|have a bun in the oven|bear|carry|gestate|]. He mashes up art and science by using equipment from a university lab: a stereoscopic microscope and a sophisticated scanning electron microscope. ","Not too many [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] are working with this kind of [approach|come near|set about|go about|border on], said Kariko, an assistant professor of [fine|finely|delicately|exquisitely|very well] art photography at East Carolina University.","The [result|leave|lead|ensue|resultant role] has been the creation of more than 50 images, many of which are stunning in their [color|colour|discolor|discolour|gloss] and [detail|contingent|particular|item|point]. ","That's what first attracted me to this, he said. With the naked [eye|eyeball|center|centre|middle], you see the insect as [brown|browned|brownish|chocolate-brown|dark-brown] [bug|wiretap|tap|intercept|tease]. But when you [enlarge|elaborate|lucubrate|expatiate|exposit|] it, you really see the wonderful colors that come from the [process|serve|swear out|work|work on].","As the [project|externalize|externalise|send off|cast] progressed, he began to [experiment|try out|experimentation] with how the [light|lightly|easy|loose|promiscuous] from the lab equipment played [off|away|forth|sour|turned] the insects. ","The [light|lightly|easy|loose|promiscuous] is inspired, he said, by paintings from some of the Dutch masters like Johannes Vermeer. ","It's a fun [project|externalize|externalise|send off|cast], most of all, Kariko said. They're meant to be [sort|classify|class|assort|sort out] of [tongue|clapper|spit|knife|natural language] in [cheek|boldness|nerve|brass|face]. ","In a nutshell, here's how he does it: ","Kariko may [happen|find|chance|bump|encounter] to [find|find oneself|recover|retrieve|regain] a dead insect at [home|home|interior|internal|national] or in his office. Choosing it as a candidate for a portrait, he'll [bring|fetch|bring in|lend|impart] it to a campus lab and [place|station|post|send|invest] it on a holder under a stereoscopic microscope with a digital camera mounted on [top|top|top off|crown|pinch] of it. ","Under LED lights, he'll [use|practice|apply|expend|habituate] tiny tweezers to [pose|perplex|vex|stick|get|puzzle] the insect. This takes a [steady|steadily|regular|firm|steadfast] [hand|pass|reach|pass on|turn over]. ","You have to [watch|determine|check|find out|see|ascertain] how much caffeine you have, to make sure you're very [calm|unagitated|serene|tranquil|sedate], Kariko joked. ","Next comes the really [cool|all right|fine|o.k.|ok] [part|partially|partly|in part|separate]. ","Kariko places the mounted insect into a [vacuum|vacuum-clean|hoover|vacuum cleaner|vacuity] [chamber|bedroom|sleeping room|sleeping accommodation|bedchamber] so it can be imaged under a scanning electron microscope. ","Scientists [use|practice|apply|expend|habituate] [scan|read|skim|rake|glance over]ning electron microscopes to [look|count|bet|depend|swear|rely] at some of nature's smallest objects. Traditional microscopes [use|practice|apply|expend|habituate] lenses to [magnify|blow up|enlarge|overstate|exaggerate] objects. Scanning electron microscopes [scan|read|skim|rake|glance over] objects with beams of particles called electrons -- which are smaller than atoms -- to [create|produce|make|] super-magnified images of very tiny things. ","Later, Kariko combines images from the two microscopes to [create|produce|make|] his final product. ","It takes 15 to 25 hours to make each photo, he said, depending on the insect. ","Coming [face|confront|present|front|look] to [face|confront|present|front|look] with insects that we [share|divvy up|portion out|apportion|deal] our homes and workplaces with might get a conversation going, Kariko said. That conversation, he hopes, might [help|avail|serve|help oneself|facilitate] [strengthen|tone|tone up|beef up|fortify] the [bridge|bridge over|bridge deck|nosepiece|bridgework] between the worlds of art and science."]},"imageLink":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160211183320-01-cnnphotos-bugs-tease-restricted-large-169.jpg","entities":[{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.896375","count":"11","text":"Kariko"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.28824","count":"1","text":"Johannes Vermeer","disambiguated":{"subType":["VisualArtist"],"name":"Johannes Vermeer","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johannes_Vermeer","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0bw2x","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Johannes_Vermeer"}},{"type":"Organization","relevance":"0.267826","count":"1","text":"East Carolina University","disambiguated":{"subType":["CollegeUniversity","University"],"name":"East Carolina University","geo":"35.602 -77.368","website":"http://www.ecu.edu/","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Carolina_University","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0m9_5","opencyc":"http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rwEMBsJwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/East_Carolina_University"}},{"type":"JobTitle","relevance":"0.250036","count":"1","text":"assistant professor"},{"type":"Drug","relevance":"0.242019","count":"1","text":"caffeine"},{"type":"FieldTerminology","relevance":"0.236978","count":"1","text":"digital camera"},{"type":"FieldTerminology","relevance":"0.228261","count":"1","text":"final product"},{"type":"Quantity","relevance":"0.228261","count":"1","text":"25 hours"}]},{"numberOfSimilarities":1}],[{"source":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","articleData":{"title":"Dying twin holds unborn sister's hand","content":"A Kansas family is given the news of twins, only to find out they'll most likely go home with just one newborn.

52, of what the Russian anti-doping agency called a massive heart [attack|assail|assault|set on|aggress]."],"secondary":["","In Walsh's [account|answer for|report|describe|calculate], Kamaev was quick

said he had collected unpublished actual documents, including confidential sources, regarding the development of performance enhancing drugs and [medicine|medicate|music|practice of

It is not [clear|clearly|all the way|percipient|absolved] whether Kamaev ever provided any documents.","Walsh wrote that Kamaev first made [contact|touch|adjoin|meet|reach] on Nov. 21, three days after WADA declared RUSADA non-compliant, effectively shutting [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] its operations. Kamaev remained at RUSADA until December before resigning.","Walsh said that Kamaev wanted him to be his co-[author|generator|source|writer] but that the [book|reserve|hold|Bible|Christian Bible] plans did not [proceed|continue|go on|go along|keep] [further|farther|promote|advance|boost]. Walsh added he was reluctant to [work|sour|turn|ferment|solve] with Kamaev because of the latter's poor English and former role overseeing the [drug|do drugs|dose] testing agency at a [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] when the Russian government gained more [influence|charm|tempt|determine|shape] over [drug|do drugs|dose] testing.","The [mention|cite|note|observe|remark] of a secret lab in the e-mails [report|cover|describe|account|reputation]ed by The Sunday Times echoes a [charge|blame|saddle|burden|level] in the WADA [commission|mission|charge|perpetration|committal]'s [report|cover|describe|account|reputation] that Russia operated a concealed [site|locate|place|web site|website] for screening Russian [drug|do drugs|dose] [test|quiz|screen|prove|try] samples before the material officially entered the RUSADA system.","Former RUSADA director [general|cosmopolitan|ecumenical|oecumenical|universal] Khabriev painted a different [picture|depict|render|show|visualize] in comments to [state|express|submit|put forward|posit]-[run|unravel|ladder|melt|melt down] news agency Tass, suggesting Kamaev was exploited by unnamed Americans [keen|cutting|knifelike|piercing|stabbing] to [tarnish|stain|maculate|sully|defile] Russia's reputation.","Some American publisher was ordering this [book|reserve|hold|Bible|Christian Bible] from Nikita Kamaev, Khabriev said. He asked my advice about whether it was worth doing. I couldn't [block|freeze|immobilize|immobilise|forget] him from doing it, especially if he had something to [share|divvy up|portion out|apportion|deal].","","Khabriev added that 15 days before his death he said that he didn't [want|need|require|desire|wish] to [write|spell|save|compose|drop a line] it any more, said that the main [theme|root|root word|base|stem] was being imposed on him. In the [end|terminate|stop|finish|cease], he sent them away.","In public, Kamaev had been sharply critical of the WADA [report|cover|describe|account|reputation], saying it was too heavily based on information from athletes who had themselves been [found|establish|base|ground|plant] guilty of doping and was biased against Russia.","Some of the issues have a particular acuteness and are, if you like, politicized, he said at the [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter]. Accusations that agents from Russia's FSB security [service|serve|overhaul|inspection and repair|serving] infiltrated the doping lab for the 2014 [Winter|winter|overwinter|wintertime] Olympics in Sochi were the product of an inflamed imagination and [better|best|better|best|improve] suited to a [spy|sight|stag|snoop|sleuth] movie, he added.","As [part|partially|partly|in part|separate] of the fallout from the WADA [com[miss|escape|lack|neglect|pretermit]ion|mission|charge|perpetration|committal]'s [report|cover|describe|account|reputation], Russia was banned from global [track|traverse|cover|cross|pass over] and [field|airfield|landing field|flying field|field of view] competition, and [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] [miss|escape|lack|neglect|pretermit] out on Olympic athletics competitions in August if it is not reinstated.","The IAAF, [track|traverse|cover|cross|pass over]'s world governing [body|personify|soundbox|consistency|consistence], insists Russia must [reform|straighten out|see the light|reclaim|regenerate] its anti-doping procedures and [investigate|inquire|enquire|look into] past offenses in [order|rate|rank|range|grade] to be readmitted.","Kamaev died 11 days after another former senior RUSADA official, Vyacheslav Sinev. The founding [chairman|chair|president|chairwoman|chairperson] of RUSADA, Sinev was 58 and had [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful]-[term|terminus|terminal figure|full term|condition] health problems, RUSADA spokesperson Nataliya Koshel told The Associated [Press|bid|beseech|entreat|adjure|press].","The death of the doping officials has spawned the usual [round|around|orotund|rotund|pear-shaped] of conspiracy theories a[round|around|orotund|rotund|pear-shaped] the Kremlin.

Meanwhile, tech industry leaders, including the CEOs of [Google|google|] and [Twitter|chitter|twitter|chirrup], and privacy advocates, including Edward Snowden, have voiced their [support|digest|endure|stick out|stomach|bear] for the [company|companion|accompany|keep company|ship's company].","","Apple already provided the FBI with [access|get at|memory access|access code|approach] to Farook's iCloud [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards]ups through mid-October, when he apparently stopped iCloud to [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards] up the iPhone provided to him by his employers. (Farook and his wife destroyed their personal phones before their attacks.)","The data left on the [phone|call|telephone|call up|ring] is encrypted with 256-bit AES security, the same standard used to [protect|] US government computers.","That encryption makes a brute-[force|storm|drive|ram|wedge] [attack|assail|assault|set on|aggress] on the iPhone 5C by the FBI nearly impossible. Such an [attack|assail|assault|set on|aggress] includes trying numerous passwords until the [right|correctly|aright|justly|wholly] one is [found|establish|base|ground|plant].","One of the FBI's [key|cardinal|central|fundamental|primal] arguments for forcing Apple to [unlock|] the [phone|call|telephone|call up|ring] is that agents [believe|trust|think|consider|conceive] Farook intentionally stopped backing up his [work|sour|turn|ferment|solve] [phone|call|telephone|call up|ring] to Apple's iCloud [service|serve|overhaul|inspection and repair|serving] to [keep|preserve|restrain|keep back|hold back] some information secret, according to the February 16, 40-[page|foliate|paginate|varlet|pageboy] DOJ [request|ask for|bespeak|call for|quest] (embedded below) that led to the [court|woo|romance|solicit|homage] [order|rate|rank|range|grade].","In January, while assisting the FBI and the DOJ with the ongoing investigation, Apple engineers suggested a simpler idea than bypassing the iPhone's passcode security. They recommended that the iPhone be connected to a known Wi-Fi [network|electronic network|net|mesh|meshing], such as one in Farook's [home|home|interior|internal|national] or workplace, and plugged into a [power|baron|big businessman|business leader|king] [source|reference|reservoir|generator|author] so it could automatically [create|produce|make|] a new iCloud backup overnight.","","If successful, that backup might have contained the missing information between the October backup and December 2, when the San Bernardino [massacre|slaughter|mow down|mass murder|carnage] occurred.","It wasn't [clear|clearly|all the way|percipient|absolved] whether the auto-backup idea would [work|sour|turn|ferment|solve], but the FBI never got the [chance|casual|chance|find|happen|] to [try|try on|render|strain|stress], Apple said.","The FBI didn't [respond|] to a [request|ask for|bespeak|call for|quest] for [comment|gloss|annotate|notice|remark]. But the bureau told CBS News on Friday that someone with San Bernardino County (Farook's employer, which actually owned the [phone|call|telephone|call up|ring]) remotely [reset|readjust|] the password on Farook's [account|answer for|report|describe|calculate] in the hours after the [attack|assail|assault|set on|aggress].","In a [tweet|pinch|squeeze|twinge|nip], San Bernardino County officials confirmed they had changed the password on the iCloud [account|answer for|report|describe|calculate], saying the FBI had asked them to.","","According to senior Apple executives, the password [reset|readjust|] meant that someone would [need|want|require|necessitate|ask] to [log|lumber|logarithm] in to the [phone|call|telephone|call up|ring] and [enter|embark|insert|infix|introduce] the new password before it could [sync|synchronize|synchronise|] with Apple's iCloud servers again. That wouldn't be possible without knowing Farook's iPhone passcode, which is the very thing the FBI hopes to [obtain|prevail|hold|receive|get] by compelling Apple to [modify|change|alter|qualify] its iOS software and [bypass|short-circuit|go around|get around|shunt] its [own|own|ain|have|possess] security features.","","In the [court|woo|romance|solicit|homage] [order|rate|rank|range|grade], a federal [judge|adjudicate|try|pronounce|label] offered Apple the ability to [use|practice|apply|expend|habituate] an [alternate|alternate|alternating|alternative|substitute] technological means, if one existed, to [provide|bring home the bacon|leave|allow for|allow] the FBI with [access|get at|memory access|access code|approach] to Farook's iPhone data. According to Apple, the auto-backup [scheme|intrigue|connive|outline|schema] was the [best|better|better|best|outdo] idea to [date|go steady|go out|see|date stamp].","On Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cooksaid [company|companion|accompany|keep company|ship's company] engineers had been advising the FBI and cooperating with the investigation but that the [call|predict|foretell|prognosticate|forebode] to [rewrite|revision|rescript] iOS would [create|produce|make|] a backdoor into the iPhone that hackers and malicious governments could [use|practice|apply|expend|habituate] to [undermine|cave|sabotage|countermine|counteract] the privacy and security of all iPhone [use|practice|apply|expend|habituate]rs.","The [company|companion|accompany|keep company|ship's company] on Friday asked for a three-day extension to [file|file away|charge|lodge|register] its [appeal|invoke|attract|solicitation|collection] to the [court|woo|romance|solicit|homage] [order|rate|rank|range|grade], and the deadline has reportedly been moved to February 26.","We have no sympathy for terrorists, [Cook|cook|fudge|manipulate|fake|falsify] wrote in an [open|candid|heart-to-heart|clear|capable] [letter|varsity letter|letter of the alphabet|alphabetic character|missive] to customers explaining Apple's decision to [challenge|take exception|dispute|gainsay] the [court|woo|romance|solicit|homage]'s [order|rate|rank|range|grade].

","What are you not good at? asked Tracy "],"secondary":["Anything besides this! Novak laughed. I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t actually [feel|palpate|finger|sense|find] multi-talented.

You're a professional arguer in [front|front|breast|look|face] of the [judge|adjudicate|try|pronounce|label]! You're great at paperwork!' No, you just get [credit|accredit|credit rating|citation|cite] for one [job|speculate|subcontract|farm out|caper].

","Here's an idea for a [book|reserve|hold|Bible|Christian Bible] called 'Other [People|people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi]'s Problems,' where [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] [send|air|broadcast|beam|transmit] in their problem anonymously, and then it's just collected in a huge coffee-[table|tabularize|tabularise|tabulate|postpone] [book|reserve|hold|Bible|Christian Bible] that, anytime you're feeling [low|gloomy|grim|blue|depressed], you can just [flip|impudent|insolent|snotty-nosed|interchange] through this [book|reserve|hold|Bible|Christian Bible] and be like, 'God, I'm glad I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t have those problems!'","So this is what you're doing while other [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] are watching reruns of 'Law and [Order|rate|rank|range|order|grade]'? ","No, this is what I'm doing when I'm at dinner with a friend! Novak laughed. [Like|comparable|corresponding|like|alike|similar], I'm the most anti-social person.  And they always [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] I'm writing about them. And it's [even|yet|still|tied|level] more insulting when I'm like, 'No, this has nothing to do with you.

It includes everything from an imagined rematch between the Tortoise and the [Hare|hare|rabbit], to a Comedy Central [roast|roasted|ridicule|guy|blackguard] of Nelson Mandela. ","Tracy asked, You went to Harvard, you majored in English and Spanish literature. Was any of this a bit about showing your academic cred, that you really were a writer's writer?","My [father|beget|get|engender|mother] accused me of showing [off|away|forth|sour|turned] in the [last|lastly|in conclusion|finally|last-place] story, Novak laughed.

I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] of entertaining [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] as [better|best|better|best|improve] than showing [off|away|forth|sour|turned].  So for me this was just -- I didn't [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] how else to [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out] these things. ","But just to make sure everyone knows that Novak is aware writing [short|curtly|shortly|unawares|abruptly] stories might [seem|appear|look] pretentious, he fired the first shot, making a [book|reserve|hold|Bible|Christian Bible] trailer (in [black|smutty|disgraceful|ignominious|inglorious]-and-[white|ashen|blanched|bloodless|livid], and in [French|Gallic|Daniel Chester French|French people]) with his former Office co-[star|leading|prima|star|starring|stellar] and one-[time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] girlfriend Mindy Kaling: ","","He then wrote another [book|reserve|hold|Bible|Christian Bible] for a slightly younger audience. The [Book|book|reserve|hold|Bible|Christian Bible] With No Pictures is one of those ideas he once wrote [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] in a note[book|reserve|hold|Bible|Christian Bible].  ","I [believe|trust|think|consider|conceive] you are the only person to [write|spell|save|compose|drop a line] a [book|reserve|hold|Bible|Christian Bible] with no pictures for preschool-[age|senesce|get on|mature|maturate] kids, Tracy said.","I would [imagine|think|opine|suppose|reckon] I am!","That's quite a distinction.","It is!

Novak agonized over every [word|Bible|Christian Bible|Book|Good Book|Holy Scripture] of gibberish, and the [color|colour|discolor|discolour|gloss] and [size|size of it|sizing] of every font.  ","Oh yeah, I was obsessive, he said. I drove them crazy. I went through two designers for a [book|reserve|hold|Bible|Christian Bible] that, like, looks like the plainest thing in the world.","Benjamin Joseph Novak was born in Newton, Massachusetts, and credits his [love|sleep together|roll in the hay|make out|make love] of writing to his [father|beget|get|engender|mother], one of the most famous authors you've never heard of. William Novak was the ghostwriter behind many bestsellers, including memoirs for Nancy Reagan and Lee Iacocca. And his [job|speculate|subcontract|farm out|caper] provided B.J. with a real life story that sounds like something he might make up: As a child he played Scattergories with Michael Jackson.

He became a [captain|headwaiter|maitre d'hotel|maitre d'|senior pilot] in the Illinois National [Guard|guard|defend|hold|ward|guard duty], and an adjunct professor at Quincy University.","He definitely was a pillar of this community, no [question|wonder|interview|query|interrogate] about it, Gough remarked.","But friends [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out] with [power|baron|big businessman|business leader|king], came ego.

While Curtis had spent years focused on his professional life, the [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful] hours away from Cory and the kids were starting to take a [toll|bell|price|cost] on their personal life.","From what we learned now, and he eventually admitted, they had a volatile relationship, said Gough.","Neighbors around the Lovelace [house|put up|domiciliate|theater|theatre] on Kentucky Street [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out] that in the months leading up to her death, they had heard loud and contentious arguments between Cory and Curtis.

","","","Amazingly, Curtis and Cory managed to [keep|preserve|restrain|keep back|hold back] their problems from their closest friends, like Belko, who years before, had moved away from their small town.","Was there a [point|repoint|sharpen|taper|target] in [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] where any of you started to see things changing between the two of them? Maher asked the friends.","No, said Belko. ","No indication that there was [trouble|ail|pain|trouble oneself|bother] coming up? Maher asked.","I never had any, Belko replied.

At 1869 Kentucky, it was a [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize] day and Cory Lovelace would usually have her hands [full|fully|to the full|wide|wide-cut].","Cory was a [stay|quell|appease|last out|ride out] at [home|home|interior|internal|national] mom, Gough explained. She was always hustling, always trying to get the kids wrangled around and to where they needed to be.","That morning seemed like so many others. According to Curtis Lovelace, Cory helped get the kids [ready|quick|ready|fix|prepare]. They had [breakfast|] and jumped in dad's car. It was 8:15 a.m.","Curtis then took the three oldest children to [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize], Gough said.

The woman, named Erica, was eight years his junior.  They married two years later, but she and his then-14-year-old daughter, Lyndsay, didn't get along.

He consulted the original pathologist, Dr. Jessica Bowman, who had ruled the death undetermined. Bowman told Gibson she would no longer [participate|enter|take part] in the [case|encase|incase|display case|showcase], but sent him for another opinion to another pathologist she knew in Chicago, Dr. Shaku Teas.","She said basically that she [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] nothing suspicious about the death, Det.

","What do you [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of] as the first thing that struck you about that [file|file away|charge|lodge|register]? Was there anything in there that you looked at and said, '[Well|well|comfortably|advantageously|intimately|considerably], that's interesting,' Maher asked Dr. Turner.","Yes. It was the scene photographs ... the presence of rigor mortis and the [position|put|set|place|pose|] of the hands is unusual ... the hands weren't resting on a [surface|come on|come out|turn up|show up].

Maher asked Dr. Turner.","So she was on her [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards]. And her arms were like this.  A little bit [lower|frown|glower|lour|depress] than that, she replied, positioning Maher's arms, as shown in the photo above.","And-- if they were stuck in this [position|put|set|place|pose|], they're in rigor-- what does that [tell|distinguish|separate|differentiate|secern|secernate] you at that [point|repoint|sharpen|taper|target]? Maher asked.","[Well|well|comfortably|advantageously|intimately|considerably], that more [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] has passed than the [witness|find|see|attestant|attestor] stated, Dr. Turner replied.","The [witness|find|see|attestant|attestor] being Curtis Lovelace, who said he had talked to his wife less than an hour before finding her dead. ","In my [report|cover|describe|account|reputation], I stated 10 to 12 hours. Rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours.  And with her arms in that [position|put|set|place|pose|], which -- with the -- the emergency responders coming in, they were still in that [position|put|set|place|pose|], suggests to me that she was in [full|fully|to the full|wide|wide-cut] rigor, said Dr. Turner.","Based on the photos, the [autopsy|necropsy|postmortem|post-mortem|PM] [report|cover|describe|account|reputation] and [police|patrol|police force|constabulary|law] [report|cover|describe|account|reputation]s, Dr. Turner pinpointed the [cause|induce|stimulate|have|get] of death: suffocation at the hands of another.","What did you [determine|check|find out|see|ascertain] would have caused the suffocation? Maher asked.","[Well|well|comfortably|advantageously|intimately|considerably], with the [position|put|set|place|pose|] of the hands, it suggests that there was an [object|aim|objective|target|physical object] between her hands and her [body|personify|soundbox|consistency|consistence].  ...And it appears that there is a [pillow|rest] missing, Dr. Turner replied.

Gibson had a new timeline and a [cause|induce|stimulate|have|get] of death, he also had one big problem.

","The one thing I do [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] is, the science of Cory Lovelace doesn't [match|equal|equalize|equalise|equate] that story, said Gibson.","Gibson believes the children may have simply been mistaken. Maybe that's because they weren't interviewed by the original detective, Jeff Baird, until two days after their [mother|beget|get|engender|father|]'s death. But if Curtis Lovelace did [kill|obliterate|wipe out|toss off|pop] his wife the night before, as Dr. Turner believes, what was his motive? ","Was there a life insurance policy, Maher [ask|ask out|invite out|take out|necessitate] Gough.","...he said there was no life insurance, he replied.","Was he having an affair?","I have not heard that, said Gough.","So what's the motive?

Again, something that develops with the passage of [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] after death, Dr. Turner told Maher. Rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours.  And with her arms in that [position|put|set|place|pose|] ... suggests to me that she was in [full|fully|to the full|wide|wide-cut] rigor.","The prose[cut|thinned|weakened|slashed|emasculated]ion uses Dr. Turner to [explain|excuse|explicate] how a [cut|thinned|weakened|slashed|emasculated] [found|establish|base|ground|plant] during the [autopsy|necropsy|postmortem|post-mortem|PM] on Cory's lip was caused by her being suffocated.","There's a [bruise|hurt|wound|injure|offend] on the inside of the lip and -- and with it a laceration. And that's from [blunt|crude|stark|candid|forthright] [force|storm|drive|ram|wedge] trauma.  So some [force|storm|drive|ram|wedge]ful [pressure|blackmail|blackjack|coerce|hale] was applied to the [mouth|talk|speak|utter|verbalize], she explained.","But then, in this [battle|combat|conflict|struggle|fight] of the experts, the defense counters with their [own|own|ain|have|possess], Dr. George Nichols.  He says Cory most likely died of causes related to an enlarged liver due to drinking and her bulimia.  ","I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] she died as a [result|leave|lead|ensue|resultant role] of natural diseases related to her liver disease. But the corroborative tests to [confirm|reassert|corroborate|sustain|substantiate] that were not performed, so I cannot come to that conclusion scientifically, said Dr. Nichols.","My opinion is, there's no [proof|proof|proofread|validation|substantiation] that this woman was murdered, he said.","And as to Dr. Turner's [claim|take|exact|lay claim|arrogate] that the degree of rigor mortis shows she had to be dead 10 to 12 hours?  ","As I said repeatedly in there, rigor mortis does not [occur|come|happen|hap|go on] at a specific, fixed [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter].  There's huge variability from person to person, Dr. Nichols stated. ","[Further|farther|further|promote|advance|boost], he said, Dr. Turner was only working from photos -- she never actually [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] Cory's [body|personify|soundbox|consistency|consistence] in person.  ","And as to that [single|single|undivided|exclusive|individual|unmarried] [cut|thinned|weakened|slashed|emasculated] on Cory's lip?  Nonsense, says Dr. Nichols.","That's eliminated, because she does not have sufficient injuries to the inner [surface|come on|come out|turn up|show up] of her lips, he told 48 Hours.","But she did have that one injury, a 48 Hours producer pointed out.","One. Not multiple.  How many teeth do I have? Dr. Nichols said, showing his teeth. OK?  Each of those is capable of making at least one, if not more, injuries to the inside of my lips as I'm fighting [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards] against someone who's holding a [pillow|rest] over me.","If the testimony of the dueling pathologists had jurors scratching their heads, it was in stark [contrast|counterpoint|line|dividing line|demarcation] to the testimony of the Lovelace boys, which clearly pulled at their hearts.","The kids [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] be in my [mind|bear in mind|beware|heed|listen] probably forever, said juror Theresa Tarr.","The prosecution called the youngest son, Larsen, who was 4 years old at the [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] of his [mother|beget|get|engender|father|]'s death, who recounts his story about poking mommy to [wake|awaken|waken|rouse|wake up] her up.  Juror Theresa Tarr was struck by the [image|visualize|visualise|envision|project|fancy].","It was an emotional testimony, she said. Thinking that a four-year-old mighta been pokin' his dead mom, it was very emotional.","My children have dealt with enough [pain|anguish|hurt|trouble|ail] in their life for them to [feel|palpate|finger|sense|find] any kind of [pain|anguish|hurt|trouble|ail], an emotional Christine Lovelace said.","Then, the defense called the two older sons, Logan, now 18, and dressed in his military [uniform|undifferentiated|consistent|unvarying], and Lincoln, now 17. A normally stoic Curtis breaks [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] when each of the two older boys takes the [stand|resist|fend|stand up|place upright], recounting how Curtis came to [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize] that day to [tell|distinguish|separate|differentiate|secern|secernate] them their [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] had died.","Both boys emphatically [tell|distinguish|separate|differentiate|secern|secernate] the [court|woo|romance|solicit|homage], they are 100 percent certain they [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] their [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] alive that morning. Logan said he [even|yet|still|tied|level] remembers asking his ailing mom if he could [stay|quell|appease|last out|ride out] [home|home|interior|internal|national] from [school|educate|train|cultivate|civilize] to take [care|worry|manage|deal|handle] of her. ","There are [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] who have accused the kids of lying, that's not who the kids are, Christine  Lovelace said. Kids [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] [share|divvy up|portion out|apportion|deal] experiences as they [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] them, not what they're told to.","And then came Lyndsay, the final [key|cardinal|central|fundamental|primal] testimony for the prosecution. She was 12 at the [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] her [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] died, and now she's the [star|leading|prima|star|starring|stellar] [witness|find|see|attestant|attestor] at her [father|beget|get|engender|mother]'s trial.","So how important is Lyndsay's testimony? Maher asked Gough.","Oh, it's critical.  It's the whole ballgame, he replied.","[Up|up|upwards|upward|upwardly|up] until this trial, Lyndsay had always insisted she [saw|power saw|sawing machine|proverb|adage] her [mother|beget|get|engender|father|] alive that morning. But now, at [age|senesce|get on|mature|maturate] 22, and under oath in the courtroom, she says can't be sure about what she remembers from that day.","And I've had a [long|farseeing|farsighted|foresighted|foresightful] [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] to [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] about that and it's almost frustrating not to [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of], because you [want|need|require|desire|wish] to, she said in an [interview|question|consultation|audience] with Dreasler.","And yet, immediately afterwards,  defense attorneys [show|usher|read|register|record] a [videotape|tape] made just two years earlier,  where Lyndsay tells Det. Adam Gibson she absolutely remembers seeing her mom alive that morning. ","In the [end|terminate|stop|finish|cease], if you can't, you can't [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of], she said. ...and just [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out], 'I'm sorry. It was 10 years ago I can't [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of].'","Were you surprised by Lynd[say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out]'s testimony when she got up and said, Now I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of]. I can't definitively [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out] anything? Maher asked Det. Gibson.","Yeah.  You never [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] what anybody is gonna [say|pronounce|articulate|enounce|sound out], he replied.","Lyndsay changing her story, the testimony of her brothers, and the dueling medical experts -- it all had the jurors heads spinning.  ","She didn't [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of], and that, to me, was very hard.  Because two years earlier, she had given a statement to Adam Gibson, that she [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of]ed a [lot|distribute|administer|mete out|deal|parcel out], said jury foreperson Adam [Buss|snog|kiss|buss|osculate|osculation].","In the [course|naturally|of course|run|flow] of deliberations, I changed my [mind|bear in mind|beware|heed|listen], said juror Mike Hayden.","You [answer|suffice|do|serve|resolve] one [question|wonder|interview|query|interrogate].  But it spawns another [question|wonder|interview|query|interrogate], Maher noted.","[Right|correctly|right|aright|justly|wholly], another juror agreed.","On Feb. 4 2016, closing arguments [begin|start|lead off|commence|get down]. Curtis Lovelace, who has prosecuted cases in this very courthouse, walked in for the conclusion of his [own|own|ain|have|possess] [murder|mangle|mutilate|slay|hit] trial. His new wife, Christine, says the trial has taken a [toll|bell|price|cost] -- especially on Curtis' sons.","We [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] that everyday the [focus|focalize|focalise|sharpen|concenter] is bringing their [father|beget|get|engender|mother] and my [husband|conserve|economize|economise|hubby] [home|home|interior|internal|national], she said. It's so cumbersome to be raising a family while we're still doing all that we're doing. We're managing, it's difficult but we're managing.","For Det. Adam Gibson, who started it all, the stakes couldn't be any higher. ","I [want|need|require|desire|wish] [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] to [remember|commemorate|commend|think back|think of] Cory outta all this ... she deserves to have her day just like everybody else, he told Maher. The jury [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] [decide|settle|resolve|adjudicate|make up one's mind] if somebody took that life from her.","And you'll [live|alive|hot|bouncy|lively] with the decision, whatever it is? Maher asked.","Whatever it is, Det. Gibson replied.","But that decision may not be so easy.","The length of [time|clock|prison term|sentence|meter] that it takes for rigor mortis to [set|hardened|determined|dictated|set] in, I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] I've heard it a half a dozen different ways, so I'm not sure.  And if I'm not sure, I'm not sure a jury member is sure, Gough pointed out.","How many of you thought it boiled [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] to you either believed the kids, or you believed the science? Maher asked the [group|aggroup|mathematical group|radical|chemical group] of jurors. All six raised their hands.  ","Going [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards] on the hands thing, that was the most debated thing in that deliberation [room|board|way|elbow room], as far as I'm concerned, juror Adam [Buss|snog|kiss|buss|osculate|osculation] said. I [mean|bastardly|beggarly|mingy|miserly], we had jury members on the [floor|deck|coldcock|dump|knock down|], you [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out], just - 'How do we [lay|laic|secular|put down|repose]?  How you [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out], do we [hold|agree|concur|concord|declare] the covers?'","Jury members got on the [floor|deck|coldcock|dump|knock down|] -- [put|arrange|set up|order|place] themselves in this [position|put|set|place|pose|] like this. To [try|try on|render|strain|stress] and [figure|calculate|cipher|cypher|compute] it out, Maher commented.","[Right|correctly|right|aright|justly|wholly], said [Buss|snog|kiss|buss|osculate|osculation].","And did that [help|avail|serve|help oneself|facilitate]?  Did the [show|usher|read|register|record]-and-[tell|distinguish|separate|differentiate|secern|secernate] of it [help|avail|serve|help oneself|facilitate] you?"," It did.  But it--it almost left more questions than answers, he said.","","Meanwhile across town, Lyndsay Lovelace -- estranged from her [father|beget|get|engender|mother], stepmother and brothers -- awaited the verdict from the [comfort|ease|soothe|console|solace] of the [home|home|interior|internal|national] she shares with her grandmother.","Yeah, we [need|want|require|necessitate|ask] a verdict. We [need|want|require|necessitate|ask] some kind of [closure|cloture|closedown|closing|shutdown] -- some kind, said Steve Belko."," And hopefully the boys, the family, the grandparents--that everybody can get [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards] together again someday [down|downwards|downward|downwardly|gloomy] in the future, said Beth Dobrzynski.","If [found|establish|base|ground|plant] guilty, Curtis Lovelace could [spend|expend|drop|pass] the [rest|pillow|perch|roost|reside] of his life behind bars. ","I haven't gotten a [lot|distribute|administer|mete out|deal|parcel out] of [sleep|kip|slumber|log Z's|catch some Z's] in the [last|lastly|in conclusion|finally|last-place] year-and-a-half. Every minute is spent thinking about what we could we be doing ... with the goal of bringing Curtis [home|home|interior|internal|national] and proving his innocence, said Christine Lovelace.","After 16 1/2 hours of jury deliberations over two days, Lyndsay received that much anticipated [call|predict|foretell|prognosticate|forebode].","Breaking news here inside the Adams County Courthouse. [Judge|judge|adjudicate|try|pronounce|label] Hardwick did just now [declare|adjudge|hold|announce] a mistrial, Jenny Dreasler reported.Curtis' current wife could be seen sobbing ... the three Lovelace boys all holding hands before that verdict was reached.","","","It was unreal and ... I [felt|felt up|mat up|matt-up|matte up] so [empty|empty-bellied|hollow|vacuous|evacuate] and out of [breathe|emit|pass off|rest|catch one's breath] and the only thing I could do was [hug|embrace|bosom|squeeze|clinch] my kids and [let|lease|rent|get|have] them [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] it is going to be OK and it is going to be OK, Christine Lovelace said of the jury's decision.","This is just dragging it out more. But if they're hung, they're hung. And there's nothing we can do about it. We just [wait|waitress|expect|look|await] for the next [round|around|orotund|rotund|pear-shaped], Lyndsay said of the outcome. ","It's [set|hardened|determined|dictated|set] for retrial.  And we [plan|design|project|contrive|be after] to [retry|] it, said Prosecutor Ed Parkinson.","If there's no new [evidence|tell|testify|bear witness|prove], how do you [paint|rouge|blusher|key|pigment] it in a different [light|lightly|easy|loose|promiscuous] and not [put|arrange|set up|order|place] yourself in a [position|put|set|place|pose|] of a hung jury again? Maher asked. ","Maybe not [paint|rouge|blusher|key|pigment] in a different [light|lightly|easy|loose|promiscuous].  Might [paint|rouge|blusher|key|pigment] it in the same [light|lightly|easy|loose|promiscuous] and with a different jury, he replied.","But this jury fought until the [end|terminate|stop|finish|cease].","Did it ever [become|suit|turn|go|get] contentious? Maher asked the six jurors.  ","It did. I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve], probably five of the jurors said, 'There is no way anybody is ever gonna [change|deepen|transfer|exchange|interchange] my [mind|bear in mind|beware|heed|listen].' And two of those, I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve], were for guilty, three for not guilty, juror Mike Hayden said. And that just deflated me so much. ","Joyce ... you [believe|trust|think|consider|conceive] he did it? Maher asked.","I [believe|trust|think|consider|conceive] he did it, said Stevens.","He's not guilty.  And they didn't [prove|raise|leaven|rise|test] it to me, said Tarr.","I had a feeling, after that first day, we weren't gonna come to a unanimous decision, said Stevens.","We're stuck, Maher noted.","It was pretty -- it was pretty obvious, Stevens affirmed.","Steve, do you [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] that Curt killed Cory? Maher asked Steve Belko.","I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out]. I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t wanna [believe|trust|think|consider|conceive] it. Because everything I [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] about Curt, he could not have [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]e it. And -- I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t [even|yet|still|tied|level] [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] if it would've been [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]e in a crime of passion, he replied. I [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] of Cory on that. Because I [know|sleep together|roll in the hay|love|make out] Cory is -- is one tough cookie. She'd have fought to the death to [defend|maintain|represent|champion|fight] her children.","I [don|wear|put on|get into|assume]'t [hear|listen|take heed|try|learn] anyone in this little triad saying, 'No way, no how, he didn't do it,' Maher said to the Lovelace's friends. There's nobody here pounding their fists saying, 'My friend didn't do it.'","I wouldn't [go|fail|go bad|give way|die] that far. I'm not entirely sure, said Belko.","I wouldn't [go|fail|go bad|give way|die] that far, either, said Beth Dobrzynski.","It's definitely [put|arrange|set up|order|place] a huge [question|wonder|interview|query|interrogate] in my [mind|bear in mind|beware|heed|listen]. Was there something-- some [reason|argue|reason out|conclude|cause] she died other than natural causes, said Bret Schrader.","As the entire town awaits this new trial, speculation and [gossip|chew the fat|shoot the breeze|chat|confabulate|confab] [continue|cover|extend|stay|stay on].","The [question|wonder|interview|query|interrogate] everyone has: what does the future [hold|agree|concur|concord|declare] for Curtis Lovelace?","How does he get his life [back|backward|backwards|rearward|rearwards] ... in his hometown? said Gough.","Because in the [court|woo|romance|solicit|homage] of public opinion, you [think|intend|mean|remember|retrieve] [people|multitude|masses|mass|hoi polloi] [will|bequeath|leave|testament|volition] always [feel|palpate|finger|sense|find] like he did something, said Maher.","Yeah.  Yeah. And again when this ends ...
